# MERT practical exercise
# Generate hypotheses from a starting-point parameter vector
# The initial parameter vector is:
#  1.0,0.697263,0.396540,2.270819,-0.145200,0.038503,29.518480,-3.411896,-3.732196,0.217455,0.041551,0.060136
# The first field is the LM feature weight (since there is only one LM in this example);
# the remaining fields are the grammmar feature weights.
# Note that these are the values that should be updated after each iteration of MERT, 
# e.g. through using command line options to override parameter file settings.
