parliament does not support amendment freeing tymoshenko
the amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former prime minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences .
the verdict is not yet final ; the court will hear tymoshenko ' s appeal in december .
the proposal to remove article 365 from the code of criminal procedure , upon which the former prime minister was sentenced , was supported by 147 members of parliament .
libya ' s victory
muammar kaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert . without him , the war is over .
as a rule , islamists win in the country ; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for stealing is having one ' s hand amputated .
instead of a dictator , a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by koran .
however , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of libya .
their only excuse is that from their point of view , nato raids were not controlled by an american general , but allah , the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike .
we participated in a shooting , served islam , and our politicians got rid of a dictator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit .
the locals thus do not have to worry about expelling of the " crusaders . "
it is quite likely that they will not . the west will then finally be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights .
new era of crisis commences
a statistical storm blew over europe on tuesday .
between quarters , the czech economy stagnated ; germany and france are growing .
investors are no longer looking at only italy ; they now focus on spain , france , austria , and others .
germany ' s gdp has grown by the expected 0.5 % ; and france ' s by 0.4 % .
in this year ' s third quarter , the czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % .
the results are worse than estimates by analysts .
in this year ' s third quarter , czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % ; however , it stagnated between the quarters .
between july and september , the economy of both the eurozone and the european union grew , compared to the previous quarter , by 0.2 % , which corresponds with estimates by analysts .
the earnings on its 10 - year bonds are 28.45 % .
even austria , netherlands , france , and belgium , etc . are beginning to experience problems .
voices are coming from germany , suggesting that ecb be the last resort creditor .
in montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate a 200 million windfall .
thanks to both the great čech and beautiful goal of petr jiráček , they won 1:0.
ihned . cz watched the progress match in a detailed report .
czech representation team , partially due to the home team ' s failure in the close ; the great čech ; and heroic jiráček ; won 1:0 in montenegro , and celebrates moving on to the european championship .
damjanovic and vucinic became the match ' s least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities .
from the opening minutes , the game was very pugnacious .
that was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half . long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the czech defence .
they created a live shield .
the gesture is to express their support of their country ' s nuclear program against a possible israel attack .
in isfahan , iran , several hundred university students created a live chain around isfahan uranium conversion facility .
in its recent report , the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) stated that everything leads to the conclusion that iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon .
at tuesday noon , students ' prayers in front of the entrance into isfahan uranium conversion facility were followed by their chanting of death to both the usa and israel .
an obese child ' s diet : no breakfast and sausage for dinner
as a recent research shows , obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle .
for example , sausages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
moreover , the families of obese children do not practise sports . however , this concerns a majority of families of current schoolchildren - only 15 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
the research took place at the end of last year ' s school year ; it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout bohemia .
so far , the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to 8th grades .
" for example , only half of those inquired said they have five meals a day , in the breakfast - snack - lunch - snack - dinner pattern , one of the basic preconditions of correct diet , " one of the results of the research says .
experts warn that even relative details are crucial for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family breakfast .
in a majority of families , everyone has breakfast separately .
yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet .
nearly everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day ( 70 % ) .
compose your own menu
" diet preferences of czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal as regards healthy diet . "
" especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks , " the final report of the survey concludes .
however , children showed very little interest in legumes , fish , and vegetable lunches .
the survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits provided they are given correct information .
this was quite significant , for example , in case of sweet soft drinks , where more children would begin to prefer plain water .
a stylist must also be a good psychologist , professionals claim
i had no idea what was coming .
and more is yet to come .
the training takes place every saturday and sunday , but it is really packed with information .
a majority of women are not perfectly symmetrical .
a stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders , make the neck look longer , or add the curves necessary .
for example , if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom - made .
in a custom - made skirt , you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting , rolling up , sticking out in your waist , etc .
given the abundance of such information and figure types , i am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
each of the course participants was given a celebrity to create two outfits for : day and night .
i am to dress miranda kerr whom you may know from the victoria ' s secret campaigns .
we must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the internet and print and graphically process them .
it is important to think about the graphic part of styling .
this is what a stylist and designer , mario kameník , was telling us about .
a stylist needs general knowledge
a stylist , honza pokorný ; a fashion designer , jakub polanka ; and a fashion photographer , ben renč .
a good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .
for example , a trench coat may be worn in the standard way , over jeans and t - shirt , as a coat ; but it may also be worn on naked body , with step - ins , as a dress .
" play with it , " he emphasised .
' then you can start breaking them , ' jakub told us .
not to mention fashion shows .
so , for a ten - page fashion story ( equals ten outfits ) , i have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
we must therefore take that into consideration when creating an outfit .
just look at madonna , who is no miraculous singer , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .
even famous people often consider it redundant ( believing it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .
then , we are left to google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining / losing weight , etc .
our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress ; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist .
" if a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire wardrobe telling her how awful the clothes are . "
he also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .
aside from the obvious things , such as scissors , a sticky roller , or safety pins , it should have a nylon thread ( for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats ) , special clip - ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large ( pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a sewing set .
even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the soles might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .
you must not touch the shoes with the scissors , to avoid any damage .
mario pleased me by praising my job .
this is just a fragment of what we heard during the second weekend course session .
v need for speed : the run takes place across america .
an originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes .
before it was released , the new version subtitled the run created high expectations .
we were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .
the game represents a possibly decent arcade race , but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years .
the adventure opens very well .
you get in the car on the west coast , in san francisco , and your task is to be the first one to reach new york .
the route is divided into ten stages , subdivided into over fifty races .
one thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things .
still , it is nothing world - shattering .
in addition , the races are , from time to time , enlivened by an untypical feature .
on the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be careful not to get under an avalanche .
there are just a few types , but it is sufficient .
on top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult .
they are just interactive animations , where most of the time jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time .
it is a surprise though , that these parts are much less in number than you would expect ( just three to be precise ) .
the driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts .
if you are looking for a real - to - life simulation , you will have to look elsewhere .
so far , everything is just right .
in contrast with the driving model , the collision model is not that good .
typically , when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic , you sometimes lightly touch the other car . yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes .
this is not such a big deal due to the restart system , but is enough to spoil the fun .
nevertheless , there are only five restarts available per each race .
this makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .
a significant shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places .
at other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration , no matter if you come first , fifth , five seconds earlier , or one minute later .
it makes no difference when you get to them ; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose .
while playing the game , you find several places , where , regardless of time , the same competitor overtakes you at the very same spot .
obviously , your rival has to get in front of you no matter what .
one can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and adrenalin - filled , but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly .
it is not important whether the reason you do not get bored is the concept with fifty unique tracks , ordering of races , or something else .
you have to watch out for gas stations along the way , as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient .
sports cars are suitable for cities ; strong american cars for straight highway sections ; and exotic supersports cars for technical driving , such as along crooked mountain tracks .
here , you gain both medals and experience points for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .
again , the profile is interconnected with an on - line autolog function , which , among other things , compares the results you have reached with those of other players , and ensures community functions .
you and your car get into a subway tunnel ( let ' s say you do ) , where you speed down the tracks in the darkness ( let ' s say you do ) .
for several days , our editorial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such morons .
it is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases rather tragically , decreases .
the sound is all right ; the soundtrack is a matter of taste .
overall impression of need for speed : the run is quite confused .
however , the game feels unfinished .

czechs have the reputation of being negative and euro - sceptical
" i did not expect it to be such a tough war . "
she proved how true she is to her " clearly and openly about europe " motto in the very first part of her lecture , where she described individual eu organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelligible , way that many lecturers from the uk law dept . could be jealous .
" at first , critics said he was plain , a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles ; i have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role . "
she explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question : " who is the european union ? which phone number should i call ? " ; i . e . as an important step to unification and better clarity of union ' s policy towards countries such as china or india .
vicenová further focused on the agenda crucial for the eu in the past , present , and near future .
czechs were dealing with the coming financial crisis ; they solved the as crisis ; and organised the east partnership summit .
currently , czech representatives in the eu has been very busy .
in addition , a new seven - year eu budget needs to be passed , which is very complicated due to the current crisis .
the ambassadress reminded the key slogans she took to brussels : " about europe , clearly . "
how are citizens supposed to understand that in brussels , people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers , different size bananas , or that someone wants to ban our cheese specialties . '
multispeed europe is coming
she wishes more czech representatives were involved in european institutions .
along with the success of czech presidency , she highlighted the power and cooperation of the visegrad group .
in the union ' s future , vicenová expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states .
" we have both countries inside and outside the eurozone . "
" for the first time it was said that the countries who want are to cooperate , while those who are not willing can stand off . "
in this regard , she appreciated the roles of both the czech republic and herman van rompuy in pushing forward the rule based on which , all topics influencing the entire eu should be negotiated by all member states , and not just those belonging into the eurozone .
the imb innovator starts the second century of its existence
to the wide public , imb is a symbol of technological revolution ; the company is seen as a highly temporary one , yet it was founded over a hundred years ago .
he believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think .
moreover , it was the foundation of company culture watson was building carefully .
imb survived and flourished for a hundred years , because it remained true to its original values , while it was not afraid to change everything around itself .
in the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more , " says current company director , samuel j . palmisano , on the occasion of the anniversary .
in the 1930s , watson approached employee care similarly to baťa in the czech republic - people from imb were among the first american employees to have a paid holiday , insurance from their employer , an elegant uniform , and a sophisticated system of bonuses for the best inventors and businessmen .
from the very beginning , the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people . it was one of the first world companies to abolish all discrimination , which rendered it with great selection .
she has been working in imb for thirty years ; she is currently a director of sales , marketing , and strategy .
it is no surprise that the ideas are plentiful - the company employs nearly half a million people .
company ' s strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image .
" ibm is not a technology firm ; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology , " george colony of forrester research consultation company adds .
during the hundred years , imb , or the " big blue , " as it is called in the us because of its logo , has grown into one of the largest companies in the world .
it holds the most patents of all american technology companies ; five of its employees were awarded the nobel price .
with about 220 billion dollars , based on market capitalisation , ibm has become the second largest technology company ( apple being number one ) this year , overrunning microsoft for the first time since 1996.
not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period . for example , ibm failed with its own operating system os / 2 ; prodigy on - line services ; and ibm pcjr computers .
that is why ibm easily builds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work , it leaves them .
perspective technology
while in 1990 , with over a half share , it was the strongest hardware representative .
it has continued the investments even after 2008 , when the modern economic crisis first hit the world .
so far , imb seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm .
ibm ' s company motto is to change everything , except for its values .
ibm history : from cheese cutter to space travel
it took the name of ibm in 1924 . originally , this was a brand used for company ' s branches in canada and south america .
they owned technologies such as the legendary " time clock , " i . e . a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work .
flint hired a director of a competing company , thomas j . watson , to help him with company management .
watson led the company until 1952.
during the first four years of watson ' s leadership , the revenue doubled to nine million dollars , and company ' s vast expansion into all continents commenced .
under his leadership , ibm started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language .
meanwhile , in 1964 , ibm developed the first computer family - the ibm line system / 360.
twenty years later , ibm sold computer production to a chinese company , lenovo , while buying the consultant division of pricewaterhousecoopers , and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services .
its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management .
ibm ' s history is strong even in our country .
today , ibm cz also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in brno .
rychtářová about her unfaithful husband :
darina rychtářová ( 53 ) said it is over !
however , she does not want to wait any longer , and set clear rules for her future life .
when darina rychtářová provided shelter for bartošová in her house in summer , she probably had not the slightest idea of what was going to happen to her marriage .
moreover , he publically admitted he loved her .
rychytář does not care who his wife sleeps with
" he is the biological father to my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house , no one will chase him out . "
so far , josef does not mind that his wife closed the hind gate on him .
" i will be with iveta , and i don ' t mean to change that . "
" our company still operates ; i am in charge of repairs , garden , the house , and shopping . "
he claims that if rychtářová found a new love , he would not stand in her way .
i know it ' s my fault , i fell in love with iveta , and i accept full responsibility , " josef concluded .
when you ask men to name some typical bad habits women have , they usually come up with all of them in an instant .
shopping
do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week ?
if so , then your shopping may be seen as bad habit .
still , who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all ( ideally , in various colour versions ) in the changing rooms ?
just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside . . .
" am i too fat ? "
" are you still attracted to me ? "
you do ?
not that you should stop looking after yourself , but many men are literary allergic to their partners " constant complaints about their looks .
order and cleanliness first
cleaning the windows , vacuuming , wiping the floors , dusting , scrubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week .
in case you suffer from this " deviation , " try to realise that no extremes are good ; and that within your family , order and cleanliness should not go first .
bossing about
" do you plan to wear the dirty socks tomorrow ? "
if you boss your partner around several times a day , he may find it very annoying .
maybe , if men realised that , women would not have to boss them around so much . . .
some women love gossiping , offending , and plotting against others .
every now and then , probably each of us releases a gossip here or there .
however , there are tougher gossips , women who enjoy frequent gossiping and despise everyone . they are , especially within a female work team , very dangerous for their surroundings .
during monday ' s nhl match , hockey forward , jaromír jágr ' s two assists helped philadelphia ' s victory 5:3 on carolina ' s ice . again , he leads the productivity of czech players in the game .
two assists in the match also belonged to jágr ' s team - mate , jakub voráček .
" i told him before the match he would score a hat - trick . "
" you sometimes feel such things , " explained jágr , after whose action giroux scored a goal on the first flyers " shot .
the trailing hurricanes ' voráček won the puck and presented it to maxim talbot , who scored between the circles .
specifically by giroux .
" i love playing with him . "
" i never thought that at the end of my career i would play with a hockey player like him . "
" i want to assist him . "
carolina made the match more dramatic with tuomo ruutu and dwyer ' s goal from a penalty shot , making it a single goal difference .
" pronger did great in our zone . "
" i aimed at him , and i ' m glad it worked , " voráček described his view of the last goal of the match .
czech montreal defenseman , jaroslav špaček , did not finish the match with buffalo ; he left in the second period due to an upper body injury .
tomáš plekanec failed to score on one of their raids .
" the situation is bad . "
" however , there is nothing we can do about that , we just have to face it , " jacques martin said .
" we should have made the game simpler , moving the puck out of our zone . "
with thirty interventions , czech goalie , ondřej pavelec , helped winnipeg ' s 5:2 victory over tampa bay .
development of trip prices since 1989
as travelling to the west was strictly limited , travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries .
the only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 , when we had the opportunity to travel to yugoslavia . nevertheless , the yugoslavian regime turned west , which caused significant limitations to trips to yugoslavia for czech tourists .
if a czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel , as an individual , to , for example , the soviet union or poland , an invitation letter from the country was necessary ; otherwise , individual travel was impossible .
still , that was not all .
czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible ; without the currency assurance , it was not possible to obtain financial means ( western currency ) for travelling west .
since 1989 , czech tourism thus experienced a real revolution .
a great paradox we do not realise anymore is that until 1989 , we could not freely visit the currently most popular croatia , as it was part of former yugoslavia .
czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the west . everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment .
a typical feature of czech tourism then was bringing their own food ( cans , salami , etc . ) to save money .
our living standards and average income were growing , which , around 1997 , resulted in another important moment .
by the end of 1990s , czechs did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries , except for the usa . this made our travelling even easier .
since then , direct charter flights take czech tourists to warm exotic countries . this winter , flights from the czech republic will reach twelve exotic destinations .
yet another important event of this period , symbolising our development after the revolution , came in 2008.
for the first time in history , in 2008 czechs spent more than a half of their holidays abroad ( 50.3 % ) ; and for the first time in history , they spent over 15 thousand crowns per person per holiday abroad , including their costs at the destination .
for nearly five months , czech football has had no president . there exists a risk that ivan hašek ' s successor , the head of czech republic ' s football association ( fačr ) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting , which is to take place in nymburk on thursday .
without it , voting for the three candidates will not start .
hašek resigned from his function in june . when leaving , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future .
this was fully shown on september 16 , when a new president was to be chosen .
no agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only , or also officials given power of attorney .
arguments concerning the election rules continue , though .
the view of election options has changed several times , but the key point remains the same .
" the argument is based on whether to follow the by - laws or to find another model , " says one of the three fačr vice - presidents , dušan svoboda , who represents professional football in the association ' s management .
moravia is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election .
" however , the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning ; that would completely deny the two - chamber concept , " svoboda agrees with moravia ' s arguments . he says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations .
' i wish the elections follow the by - laws to the maximum . '
pelta remains an optimist .
" all passionate stirring will calm down with today ' s prospective advance of the national team into the european championship . "
rajchl is more reserved .
" it is not between people from bohemia and moravia , but there are attempts at purposeful adjustment of regulations . "
" i hope the common sense wins , " rajchl said .
some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in montenegro ; but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match .
finally , a meeting at ministry level , said to happen on wednesday , may decide .
a lot is in the game : government grants ; football trustworthiness ; and the planned čstv general meeting dealing with new direction of czech sports following sazka ' s financial problems .
if , before the extraordinary general meeting , the head of pilsen football players , tomáš paclík , saw a strong candidate , who would meet all of his expectations of a new football association of the czech republic ( fačr ) president , he would not even apply for the top function .
" but no such person has currently been found , " paclík said to čtk .
moreover , paclík emphasizes that should he win , he would only remain the president until 2013 , when a regular general meeting is scheduled .
" i ' ve spoken to some people that could be considered . "
" i ' d like to change this opinion , " he said .
paclík therefore finds it unacceptable for pelta to become the president .
" combined with support from berbr , a capable businessman , this would be even more harmful for the football , " paclík said .
" i don ' t know what prestige pelta ' s victory would bring to football . "
in case paclík wins on thursday , he could imagine cooperation with pelta in the future .
" he ( pelta ) would be the first one i ' d go to . "
" i can see him as the head of the representation . "
" i don ' t poke my nose in what i don ' t understand either , ' said paclík , who gained a lot of attention in september , when he supported the removal of board of referees , led by luděk macela , replaced by dagmar damková .
he refers to his skills from management of private companies ; since last summer , he has been managing the pilsen team that , with his support , celebrated its first league triumph in may .
" to limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board , leading to disgusting situations , " paclík said . he does not hide his antipathy for , e . g . sparta ' s director , daniel křetínský .
" that ' s one of the key things the new president should attend to . "
paclík does not consider his connection with the pilsen club a burden , though he claims that an fačr president should be a non - party one .
" it ' s not ideal . "
pelta promised new fačr regulations that would avoid election mate
before the thursday negotiations in nymburk , a jablonec functionary remains an optimist and believes that the pre - election fight would be significantly suppressed by today ' s prospective success of our football representation .
he decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment . a two - month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context .
" they feel it ' s high time someone leads the association , " claims the man chiefly connected with the jablonec club ; but he spent many years in sparta and the association ' s executive board .
he believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of ivan hašek ' s reign .
" if various representations were not accepted , we would have had a president since september , " pelta said .
" if i become president , i will take it as my personal task , and i ' m willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails . "
other than that , he says he does not try to define himself against the rivals .
for a long time , he did not attack tomáš paclík , who has constantly criticised pelta .
" however , his attacks were not decent , and many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign . "
he sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football , from the lowest competitions to representation .
" í would also try to end all affairs , starting from the bohemians case or the aftermath of last year ' s corruption scandal . "
he then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel housecleaning .
despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , he believes that on thursday , the delegates will not come to nymburk in vain .
" football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader , " says pelta , who , two days before the crucial day of his career of a functionary , remains an optimist .
if , on thursday ' s general meeting , jindřich rajchl , the existing vice president , is to become the president of czech football association , many people in the association would reportedly not be pleased .
he wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas .
" as president , i ' d like to focus on football as a whole . "
" by this , i don ' t mean i ' d do everything on my own , " rajchl said in his interview for čtk .
' i ' ll distribute tasks strictly so that in each of these segments , football makes big steps forward . "
critical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidature .
" but i need to know if it has any sense ; and that i won ' t be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every move , " he explained his hesitation .
" that ' s a trust i can ' t just throw away , " he said .
" a great amount of work was done in those two years , and i don ' t want to throw it all away . "
" i believe in systematic approach , which is something i don ' t think mirek pelta is competent of . "
" i can be blamed for many things , but certainly not for being subjective . "
" i want to make football for everyone , because then everyone has a good time , not just the chosen few , " rajchl said .
" though some people try to claim the opposite , i plan to do the maximum for moravia . "
" this would prevent the current situation , where there are just three moravian units in the league , which is a problem concerning young players in moravia , " rajchl said .
" nevertheless , i can still feel a strong support in the czech chamber that elected me its vice president , and can see i have achieved some clear successes , " rajchl said . among his successes , he includes the saving of dozens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts , negotiating tv contracts , and negotiations about the lottery law .
while claiming that pelta has been ' disqualified from returning trustworthiness to czech football ' , he considers the other rival , paclík , a strong candidate that has things to offer .
" if he is elected , i hope he would continue in the things ivan hašek started , without significant personnel changes in the committees . "

one book can tell you where the water is at its best .
lying back on the water , she has looked up at artistically designed domes , has swum towards marble cherubs awaiting her at the edge of the pool and has marvelled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools .
the architectural historian meder looked at more than 200 swimming pools - and has now compiled here experiences in her recently published book badefreuden ( the joys of bathing ) , covering everything from public swimming baths in munich to historical bathing palaces in the black forest and " hardcore concrete buildings " in taunus .
the 46 - year - old is a real bathing culture enthusiast .
the only downside is that fans of swimming have to cope with blue glazed tiles and the stench of chlorine while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to the bright twittering of birds in the park .
" so i started collecting beautiful baths . "
splashing in the diving pool and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stimulated , according to meder .
" the surface is very transparent , but also reflects the beauty of the entire building . "
the illustrated pocketbook the joys of bathing provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of historic pleasure and health oases over 190 pages - and makes you want to leap into the water .
she found nitrate - rich water in a karst cave ( the cave bath in miskolctapolca ) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle - shaped building ( városi termálfürdö in jászberény ) in addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100 - year - old széchenyi baths in budapest .
perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in längenfeld . the aqua dome in ötztal looks like a ufo has just landed in the alps .
alhambra in the black forest
a lot of thermal baths smell of sulphur . the árpád baths in békescsaba , hungary , smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa .
iris meder , however , was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places . when she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the czech baths of luhatschowitz , she found the area sealed off .
when meder looked through the weather - beaten windows of the red , white and yellow art nouveau building , she could see weeds growing up through the tiles .
the baths have already gone through three stages of construction . you will not only discover neo - romanesque elements from the period after it was built in 1844 , but also a moorish hall in alhambra style added around 1900.
" it is a real achievement to harmonise such different architectural styles so brilliantly , " says meder .
agricultural commodities speculation
by christian teevs
according to spiegel online , josef ackermann has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world .
hamburg -
two thirds of those questioned demand that deutsche bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities , as trading deepens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world .
the study is based on a report presented by foodwatch in mid - october .
the campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , although large banking houses such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley trade in the same way .
however , most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest .
according to spiegel online , an international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the foodwatch report .
the head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of january .
ackermann working on his image
as top bank lobbyist , ackermann has a particular duty , according to bode .
" it does not matter whether this is about starving people or the reputation of deutsche bank . "
deutsche bank announced on monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been planned .
he also need have little concern for the costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome .
foodwatch is striving to keep up the pressure on the manager .
bode published the survey on tuesday . the survey was conducted for the forsa institute for social research and statistical analysis on 7 and 8 november and 1001 people took part .
many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading . according to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation .
21er haus in vienna
by ingeborg wiensowski
now it is being reopened as an exhibition centre .
schwanzer ' s pavilion won the grand prix d ' architecture in 1958 for its light floating steel - glass structure .
it made the architect so famous that he also built austria ' s pavilion at the next world ' s fair .
the pavilion , planned as a temporary exhibition building , was relocated to the schweizer garten near vienna ' s südbahnhof , converted and opened as the museum of the 20th century in 1962 - and is widely referred to as the " 20er haus " for this reason .
nonetheless , it continued to be used until contemporary art in vienna was given a new home .
the architect adolf krischanitz has now renovated the pavilion , which has been named the " 21er haus " and will be used as a contemporary art museum .
agnes husslein - arco who became the new director of the austrian galerie belvedere in 2007 was instrumental in the new beginning .
the new museum was to house the fritz wotruba foundation ' s permanent collection , a café and a bookshop alongside contemporary art . an office building was also to be built .
krischanitz was then the ideal choice to carry out the project .
he knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing , a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was relocated to vienna and converted .
the window profiles of the glass facade were replaced , fibreglass - reinforced safety glass was put in and the glass roof was replaced by high - grade safety glass .
two lower floors created space for the new use of the building , a sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the delicate schwanzer pavilion .
and the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be .
" we often had to find a material that was good , cheap and met with the approval of the monument authority , " says krischanitz , pointing to the rough flooring in the basement .
krischanitz stated recently that the pavilion " from brussels " had been tough - a typical " drop in the city " story .
the 21er haus is very much in the right place , as there has been a stroke of luck in town planning . the completely redesigned " main station quarter " with offices and residential properties is developing around the schweizer garten .
deutsche bahn plans winter crisis package into the millions
the number of employees is to double .
according to a newspaper report , deutsche bahn will spend more than 70 million euros more this year in the battle to prevent winter - time cancellations and delays .
investment is intended to improve the availability of locomotives and the rail network , even in the face of extreme weather conditions .
the aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by start of business and 90 percent of the critical points within four to five hours .
last winter , deutsche bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business , as it lacked reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions .
there is also some delay in the delivery of ice trains .
deutsche bank pays multi - million pound fine in the usa
as if the problems at home were not already enough for deutsche bank , the industry giant ' s past in the usa is now also catching up with it . frankfurt - based deutsche bank will pay 145 million dollars ( 106 million euros ) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis .
the national credit union administration ( ncua ) , a financial market regulator , accuses a string of major banks of having used false promises to mislead credit unions into buying the financial products .
" we are happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court , " said a deutsche bank spokesman in new york .
the same is true of citigroup , which agreed to pay 20.5 million dollars .
the national credit union administration ( ncua ) is responsible for the us credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits .
the current settlements are the first of their kind .
the dubious mortgage securities are so - called mortgage - backed securities .
this sealed the fate of a number of financial companies when the us property bubble exploded in 2007.
the banks battling against a strong wind in the usa several years later .
the federal housing finance agency ( fhfa ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .
deutsche bank also faces legal action by the fhfa covering multiple transactions with a total value of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
deutsche bank has rejected the claims as baseless and has declared its intention to fend off the claims .
financial guru buffett is investing heavily in the it company , ibm .
until now , the major american investor , warren buffett , had always claimed not to invest in it and computing companies , as it was difficult to forecast the long - term development .
according to buffett , he should have realised much earlier that ibm primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the it departments of other companies .
the it veteran ibm has now earned the title of " sir ibm . "
his investment holding company , berkshire hathaway , has become one of the largest shareholders in ibm with a 5.5 percent stake .
he praised the management , which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis .
for a fairly long time , ibm has focused on lucrative it services such as data centres .
buffett had avoided technology firms to date .
and invested in a freight railway , for example , a lubricant manufacturer and a machine manufacturer .
the 81 - year - old took over the small textile company berkshire hathaway in the 1960s and built it up , with clever investments , into one of the most valuable companies in the world .
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world .
the ibm share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following the announcement of buffett ' s investment .
buffett , however , has said he is not planning to invest in microsoft .
imminent danger
one newspaper speaks of a " bloody ideology " that is now resurfacing .
fear and concern has been the reaction to this report in turkey and within the german - turkish community in germany .
there was never any question , however , that xenophobia does exist in germany .
" is this a revival of the bloody ideology ? " was the headline of the internet edition of the turkish newspaper haberturk .
the turkish community of germany ( tgd ) reacted calmly , remembering the victims of racial violence during a silent vigil in front of the brandenburg gate at the weekend .
cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story .
the german edition of hürriyet also does not miss the chance to make this connection .
he points out that people have been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to germany ' s redevelopment with their work .
the authors are asking themselves why the german authorities did not think earlier to look for suspects in right - wing extremist circles .
" that will be the best self - defence . "
the attacks on mölln and solingen in the 90s are an example of what it means for peace in germany to be at risk .
no other event has shown the turks living here more clearly that there is imminent danger and shown the germans that mistrust and distance can culminate in real violence .
do not repeat the mistakes of the past
he sent a telegram of commiseration to the turkish president after the arson attack in solingen , but it was his foreign minister , klaus kinkel , who took his place at the memorial ceremony in cologne - kinkel summed up in his speech the taxes turks contribute in germany ,
the coverage by the turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mistrust of many german turks in the current german state has become since .
the lake zurich banking scandal
ubs almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling from one crisis to the next ever since .
axel weber certainly had not imagined that would be his role .
axel weber was clearly delighted , praising switzerland for its beauty and ubs for its newly won solidity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues .
" i am looking forward to working with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel . "
a ubs trader in london had bypassed all the bank ' s security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion euros .
the ubs chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is asking : when will axel weber finally arrive ?
and he will take on the role of chairman of the board in may , and not in 2013 , the bank announced on tuesday .
he is an economics professor and central banker , not a conventional banker , and clearly would need some time to adjust .
ubs is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years .
it began in the financial crisis .
the bank combined the image of the secretive and solid , but equally savvy asset manager with ambitious targets , aiming to become a major player in investment banking .
and had risen to the league of the world ' s biggest banks as an investment bank .
the former banker and long - standing banking professor at the swiss institute of banking of the university of zurich , hans geiger , explains : " i always presented ubs to my students as the model of a good bank . "
he was very wrong indeed .
in the middle of the year , ceo peter wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly stepped down .
the investment division of the bank had gambled on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions .
the bank actually managed to find investors , but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined a short while earlier - a less than transparent asian sovereign wealth fund from singapore and an arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive , even its name was not disclosed .
it got a lot worse in april 2008.
catastrophe followed in october 2008 . ubs faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state .
the whole of switzerland was shocked - the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks .
" we would not be able to save the ubs for a second time , " says banking researcher geiger .
a few months later , ubs capitulated in the tax dispute with the usa and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank .
ubs therefore more or less admitted having been an accessory to tax evasion .
swiss banking secrecy was not the same after the scandal .
the exodus of client money began .
and just as things had calmed down and ubs looked like it would start to turn things around , along came a disastrous rogue trader . a single trader gambled away 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong .
" the adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too little , " says martin janssen , economic and professor of finance at the swiss banking institute of the university of zurich .
it was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made swiss bankers the guardians of the world ' s major assets - no excessive risk , but security for money , whether the world fell apart outside the alpine republic or not .
the ubs headquarters in zurich still fit the cliché of the dignified swiss private bank - just a bit bigger .
the bank has its head office on zurich ' s bahnhofstrasse that leads from the main station directly to zurich lake , surrounded by the snow - capped peaks of the swiss mountains .
jewellers such as tiffany ' s are to be found here between traditional swiss shops such as confiserie sprüngli .
a heavy revolving door opens onto the ubs reception .
ubs knows that its clients are looking for - security .
he would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too , like all swiss bankers , does business with the two major banks .
in his opinion , the swiss have nothing to add .
it was in fact anglo - saxon investment banking that changed ubs , brought in its first big profits - and then the debacle . no other european financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major swiss bank .
" that wednesday , the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation , " writes author lukas hässig in his book the ubs crash .
how could it have come to that ?
two of the three major swiss banks consolidated into a single , vast group in june 1998.
the fact that the two banks that went to form ubs complemented each other helped . one was a wealthy but sedate bank specialising in asset management in zurich and the other was less wealthy , but much more internationalised .
two names are connected with the rise of ubs : peter wuffli , group ceo of ubs from 2001 to 2007 , and marcel ospel , chairman of the board of directors .
" wuffli , highly intellectual , modest , with a deep understanding of models and statistics , and ospel , with gut instinct who had worked his way up from being a banker ' s apprentice . "
and wuffli ultimately may have made a critical error . " he thought his models were reality , " says geiger .
tragic it may be .
employees of ubs clearly remember the management meetings where ceo wuffli always repeated the same slogan - dethrone goldman sachs .
it led the " league tables " that documented the success of the banks at that time .
it managed some of the way .
commissioned management consultants , however , pointed out a weakness . in terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as " fixed income , " ubs was far behind the very largest banks .
to plug the hole , ubs entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence .
it developed into a vast machine that packaged up securities based on us mortgage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks .
" ubs was buying as late as the summer of 2007 when the us housing market was in flames , " says banking expert geiger .
one manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated .
any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job .
banking expert geiger already has an idea - quit investment banking , focus on asset management and turn back to swiss roots .
it is clear , nonetheless , that investment banking must shrink significantly .
the 51 - year - old italo - swiss banker was actually only imagined as a transitional solution when the bank parted ways unexpectedly with his predecessor grübel .
ermotti plans to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid - 90s .
but that will not be enough .
what is ubs ?
those are the questions axel weber is definitely already asking himself .
next year .
the impending recession in europe has depressed the mood of us investors at the start of the week .
curbed industrial production on the continent nipped hopes that the debt crisis might stabilise in the bud .
the euro fell against the dollar .
financial stocks in particular were on the sales receipts .
the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points in the course of trading .
the nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 percent and closed trading at 2657 points .
industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of the upturn .
the announcement made us investors sceptical . " we are not an island . we are dependent , " said steve goldman of goldman management .
the investment legend , warren buffett , could only support such caution . in a cnbc interview , he said that it was not yet clear whether europe is strong enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis .
instead , buffett threw a decades - old principle out of the window to invest in the us technology industry .
the shares closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars .
the share price of his investment company berkshire hathaway fell 1.3 percent .
the bank is converting almost all its remaining shares in the china construction bank into cash , bringing in 6.6 billion dollars .
the aircraft manufacturer boeing gained , limiting losses on the dow .
the emirates airline ordered 50 long - range type 777 aeroplanes on sunday with an order value of 18 billion dollars .
around 710 million shares changed hands on the new york stock exchange .
630 shares finished up , 1913 down and 82 unchanged on the nasdaq on turnover of 1.38 billion shares .
rooks are considered problem birds in many places . experts now say the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from cities .
a solution to the problem birds , however , is far from within reach .
specialists from all over germany discussed possible solutions .
conservationists stated that migration of specially protected rooks was the root of the problem in cities , pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats .
crows are protected .
a controversial project to cull crows in leer was behind negative headlines in 2005.
" normal displacement and deterrence does nothing , " said town and country planner werner klöver from leer .
" the animals disperse and large colonies split up and spread to other areas . "
" we have to live with them . getting rid of them is not an option . "
a combination of deterring birds from sensitive residential areas and offering incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option .
jürgens was a co - founder of the ascherberg crow educational trail in schleswig - holstein , where notice boards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent rook .
jürgens also expressed her opinion on the criticism of the noise the birds make . " the noise conveys a lot of information . they have a lot to say to each other . "
behavioural researchers at the university of cambridge recently tested the extent of the birds " intelligence on four rooks .
they recognised the size and shape of stone needed to collapse the platform without much training .
the researchers put a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder .
however , the researchers had provided pieces of wire .
three of the four rooks even managed it at the first attempt .
the hopes of bosnians and turks for a last minute win were short - lived .
portugal , the czech republic , croatia and ireland have got the final spots for the euro 2012 championship in poland and ukraine .
the czechs only needed 1:0 ( 0:0 ) in the playoff second leg against outsider montenegro after a clear win in the first leg ( 2:0 ) .
nani ( 24th minute ) , helder postiga ( 72nd and 82nd ) and miguel veloso ( 80th ) scored the other goals for portugal .
sena lulic got a second yellow card in the 54th minute .
portugal got off to a perfect start in lisbon ' s estadio da luz .
a good quarter of an hour later , nani displayed his long - range abilities , raising the lead to 2:0 from the 25 metre line .
the former wolfsburg player from the english championship leader manchester city put a header onto the bottom edge of the crossbar in the 33rd minute , but the ball did not go over the goal line .
the referee wolfgang stark from ergolding then garnered some attention .
stark also awarded a controversial penalty for handball after a foul by fabio coentrao - misimovic converted .
petr jiracek cleared up any remaining doubt for the czechs in the 81st minute .
luck also smiled on trainer michal bilek ' s team and bundesliga legionaries michael kadlec ( bayer leverkusen ) and tomas pekhart ( 1st fc nuremberg ) with a potentially catastrophic error early on .
montenegro had its best opportunities when the stevan jovetic and dejan damjanovic duo were on the field .
after half - time , the crossbar saved the czechs " already battered world - class goalie after the forward from fc seoul retreated in the 50th minute .
turkey , meanwhile , was lacking football genius in zagreb .
while it is now virtually a certainty that national trainer guus hiddink must now give up his place on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002 , the croatians are through to the final round of a european championship for the fourth time .
selcuk inan ' s long - range shot hit the post in the seventh minute and striker kazim kazim was unable to put the rebound into the net .
the croatians continued in fine form after half - time .
trapattoni going to euro 2012
trainer giovanni trapattoni ' s team - already looking assured of a place following the 4:0 victory in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal from stephen ward .
ireland kept up the pace , but had to wait until the 23rd minute when robbie keane from los angeles had the first clean shot on goal .
the goal came in the 32nd minute .

peter englund ' s intense and bighearted new book , " the beauty and the sorrow : an intimate history of the first world war , " begins with a long dramatis personae of the sort that can make your heart sink .
you will be getting to know these people very well in mr . englund ' s novelistic telling , and this dramatis personae will function as your gps , a beacon during those few moments when , like one of his men and women , you are confused and bereft in the fog of war .
he is also the new permanent secretary of the swedish academy , which awards the nobel prize in literature .
it contains few big names , major treaties or famous battles ; there are almost no ambassadors , dashing journalists or discussions of tactics and materiel .
" the beauty and the sorrow " threads together the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women , on both sides of the war , from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers , doctors , ambulance drivers and clerks .
a few will become prisoners of war , or lose limbs , go mad or die .
mr . englund ' s book is a deviation from standard history books .
" the beauty and the sorrow " expertly pans across other theaters of war : the alps , the balkans , the eastern front , mesopotamia , east africa .
this is a moving book , almost from the start .
when cannon fire is heard in the distance , and you are a woman at home with your children , do you stay or flee ?
almost no one understands what ' s happening , even why this war is to be fought .
" the beauty and the sorrow " follows individuals like florence farmborough , an english nurse in the russian army , and richard stumpf , a young german high - seas fleet seaman .
the accounts of their lives can be terrifying or stirring , but are most fully alive in mr . englund ' s accumulation of small moments , stray details .
in telling a german schoolgirl ' s story he says : " ersatz , everywhere ersatz . "
he goes on about the ersatz food in germany .
there are , he notes , " 837 registered meat substitutes permissible in the production of sausages , 511 registered coffee substitutes . "
one american recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and declares about war : " you feel that , after all , this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and whiskey , the evening paper or the best seller , and to pretend that such a veneer means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt front . "
" once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself , one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience , " he writes .
other observations are about an old europe falling away , and about new types of terror .
he catches the arrival of what he calls " a new species in the bestiary of the young century : the articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well - cut clothes who performs his butchery while sitting behind a desk . "
mr . englund discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front .
" those who are really desperate rub it into their eyes , which often results in lifelong blindness . "
in dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war has " unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . "
the best books about world war i have often been oblique , like paul fussell ' s " great war and modern memory , " or novels , like erich maria remarque ' s " all quiet on the western front , " rather than comprehensive histories .
his book has the most devastating ending i can remember in a piece of nonfiction .
but it ' s as if he has reached from his book , snatched that dramatis personae page from your fingers , and lighted it with a match .
hundreds of police officers were involved , some of them wearing riot helmets .
the operation was kept secret from all but a few high - ranking officers , with others initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise .
there could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks , like the pepper - spraying of protesters , that violated department rules and created a firestorm of public sympathy for the squatters .
officials had prepared by watching how occupations in other cities played out .
officials increased so - called disorder training - counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on lower manhattan .
the orders to move into the park came down at the " last minute , " said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the assignment only as " an exercise . "
" the only people who were aware of them going into zuccotti park were at the very highest levels of the department . "
on oct . 14 , officials wanted to clear the park , but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans .
mr . kelly said many people , almost like commuters , had been coming and going from the park during the day , making 1 a . m . a good time to move in .
emergency service unit trucks with klieg lights and loudspeakers gathered at pike slip and the franklin d . roosevelt drive , near the manhattan bridge , before moving out .
as the community affairs officers moved into the park in their light - blue windbreakers , many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left .
other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to move in if arrests were needed in the park .
paul j . browne , the police department ' s chief spokesman , said it was for their safety .
mr . browne said television camera trucks on church street , along the park ' s western border , were able to capture images .
some protesters who refused to move were dragged out , the images appearing on the internet soon after .
some made a barrier , and the police moved in to methodically arrest them .
and two people chained themselves to trees , mr . kelly said .
no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a . m . , mr . kelly said .
mr . browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park .
the highest - ranking officer on the scene was joseph j . esposito , the chief of department , the top uniformed officer in the department .
mr . kelly , while present , was " not directing operations , " mr . browne said .
barricades were set up at cortlandt street , a block north of the park , and at pine street , a block south .
at one point , several officers , many with shields , were seen pushing people farther out .
some of the rowdiest action of the night took place south of the park .
at one point , a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd .
support workers ' union will sue city over layoffs
the lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union , district council 37 , in its effort to reverse the layoffs .
city officials have categorically denied that accusation .
one council member fired back , telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be laid off .
the suit will list mr . walcott and the city ' s department of education as defendants , and counts eight laid - off workers as plaintiffs , all of them black or latino women , as were most of the aides who lost their jobs .
according to a draft of the complaint obtained by the new york times , the union has zeroed in on the number of layoffs at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of inequitable treatment , saying poor schools lost more aides because they had been chronically underfinanced .
noting the loss of five out of eight school aides employed by public school 36 in harlem , where 68 percent of the students live in poverty , the lawsuit says , " this is not a neighborhood of well - heeled parents who can fund - raise to make up the budget shortfalls . "
the union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators .
" sixty - six parent coordinators were laid off , " the draft complaint says , " and not merely excessed . "
it finally looks like republicans and democrats on capitol hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in libya .
on tuesday , the senate foreign relations committee is to consider a resolution , sponsored by chairman john kerry ( d - mass . ) , along with sens . john mccain ( r - ariz . ) and joseph i . lieberman ( i - conn . ) , applauding libyans for their successful rebellion and u . s . troops for their " bravery . "
" it ' s an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations . "
this summer , lawmakers from both parties squabbled with each other and the white house over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the u . s . military ' s role in the nato mission in libya .
the bill was defeated in the house by a wide bipartisan margin , and it never came up for a vote in the senate .
that left the u . s . mission in a form of legislative purgatory - with congress upset enough to criticize obama ' s handling of the mission but not so angry as to actually pull the rug out from under it .
tripoli fell to libyan rebels in august , and gaddafi was killed oct . 20.
now the senate may be ready to act .
the resolution also " affirms the national interest of the united states in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in libya . "
the last version was opposed by sen . richard g . lugar ( ind . ) , the committee ' s top republican .
across the capitol , the house is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget , a top legislative priority of nearly every congressional republican and some democrats .
other lawmakers have been unsuccessful so far in bringing their amendments to the floor , but not for lack of trying .
some are duplicates - the same bill offered in both the house and senate - and others are slight variations on each other .
some of those bills are identical too , but they give their sponsors - particularly freshmen republicans looking to burnish their resumes - the chance to brag that they " authored " such a measure .
in march , 58 senators voted in favor of a non - binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment .
rep . jesse l . jackson jr . ( d - ill . ) has offered a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care , among other subjects .
some lawmakers also want to allow for the nullification of federal laws if they are opposed by two - thirds of the states .
in the 111th congress , lawmakers offered 77 such amendments , and they introduced 66 in the 110th .
but they weren ' t much more successful then than they are now .
" beat up but not beaten , " giffords speaks in first tv interview since shooting
appearing on abc news ' s " 20/20 " with diane sawyer , giffords struggled to formed sentences and needed help walking .
three months ago , she made a surprise return to the house to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt - ceiling deal .
asked by sawyer how she feels , giffords , 41 , responded , " pretty good . "
the special traced giffords ' s recovery since the jan . 8 shooting .
she is capable only of holding up one or two fingers as her husband encourages her .
a nod of the head .
and then , her first word : " what . "
videos aired by abc show that music played a central role in giffords ' s recovery : the congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists to cyndi lauper ' s " girls just wanna have fun " and tom petty ' s " free fallin . " "
her husband said that he was reading giffords a newspaper story about the shooting on march 12 when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed in the incident .
" a lot of people died , " giffords told sawyer .
at one point in his wife ' s recovery , kelly told sawyer , she said , " i ' ve been beaten . "
you ' ve just been beat up .
troops feel more pity than respect
kid rock sang a ballad about helplessness , frustration and loss .
the black - tie crowd rose to its feet and cheered .
a senior military officer at the gala , also attended by the joint chiefs then - chairman , adm . mike mullen , saw the troops " role differently .
i ' m sure the organizers meant well .
but it wasn ' t respect , really . it was pity .
the troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices .
the public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for those in uniform .
" but it seems that the only way that some can be supportive is to cast us in the role of hapless souls . "
they also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the vietnam war was far worse .
after his two sons returned from combat tours with the marines , retired col . mark cancian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives .
others would wonder whether there was an " angry , violent veteran beneath the surface , " said cancian , who fought in iraq and returned to a senior government job in washington .
" when you talk about your service , you need to counter the negative impressions , " cancian recalled telling his sons .
battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the iraq and afghanistan wars .
instead , praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member ' s suffering .
military faces mounting pressure to crack down on rape
if not , hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one .
it was october 2008 , and she was heading back to her barracks at miramar air station , just north of san diego , after dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12 - pack of beer .
" a red flag went up , " lyman says .
i thought , no , he ' s 19.
" i wish i had listened to my instincts . "
this week , on nov . 18 , lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will anxiously await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in arlington , va . , that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former defense secretary robert gates and his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , will go to trial .
filed in february by susan burke , a washington , d . c . , attorney , the suit initially involved 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men , all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers , and that the military failed to investigate , prosecute , or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks .
" the military is a top - down structure , " she says .
burke also says that since february , she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors , many of whom could be part of future suits .
the defense team for the department of defense , led by united states attorney neil macbride , has filed a motion to dismiss the case .
per a 1950 supreme court ruling called the feres doctrine , the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by active - duty personnel .
the department of defense declined to comment for this story .
while women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat , that distinction is in name only : modern wars rarely have clear front lines .
the result : between those two wars , 150 female soldiers have died - two thirds of them during combat situations .
she isn ' t alone in her fight ; three other lawsuits are under way in addition to hers .
separately , the nonprofit vietnam veterans of america is assembling a suit against the military that focuses on the " personality disorder " diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence , according to activists such as anu bhagwati of the service women ' s action network , a human - rights group .
nine separate bills have been introduced in congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes .
but assaults are notoriously underreported , and by the pentagon ' s own estimate , that figure accounts for approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year .
the plaintiffs in burke ' s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas .
that night , she says , she was asked to recount the details of her rape 11 separate times to a stream of police , doctors , and commanders .
six months later , in april 2009 , lyman sat through a hearing before a judge , during which she was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack .
" i remember the day when the verdict was read , " lyman says .
" they put me into the psychiatric unit , and when i got out , i remember saying to my command officer , " that wasn ' t his trial . that was my trial . " "
in january 2010 she was discharged under less - than - honorable terms , preventing her from receiving any benefits .
however , he notes , " in my view they should be able to move forward . "
i ' ve been a lifelong critic of the feres doctrine .
he adds , " the odds are heavily against them . . . but it ' s important for them to try . "
if the hearing doesn ' t go their way , burke , the plaintiffs " lawyer , will cue up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases .
or until we die , whichever comes first .
before he became the new face of right - wing extremism in europe , anders behring breivik was just another guy airing his anti - immigration views online .
while breivik may have acted alone , he was far from alone in cyberspace : he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer , chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right - wing groups on social - networking sites .
but how to find them ?
" we realized that it wasn ' t that difficult to get to them at all , " says jamie bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report on european digital populism by british think tank demos .
bartlett ' s team found half a million fans of right - wing groups across europe and then targeted them with ads , but instead of linking to a new band or diet product , the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level , attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future .
" it ' s quite a new way of doing research , " bartlett says .
but in something of a twist , " those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable , more democratic and less violent than those who just remain behind the computer screen . "
think tanks , medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in ' likes ' , wall posts and status updates .
for some researchers , the beauty of facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn ' t approach with a clipboard on the street .
" you ' d have to go through the party and they would never allow you access , " says bartlett .
others say the site could offer a way to identify and tackle social - health problems .
moreno suggests that students ' peers , such as residential advisors , could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts one too many boozy status updates .
" we ' ve found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed . "
the site ' s data team has worked up stats on relationship status and valentine ' s day , voter turnout in the 2010 midterms , and a national happiness index ( mainly using information only it can access - champions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast trove of data available to others for research . )
but what about when facebook users become part of a survey they don ' t even know about ?
" i don ' t think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles , " says neil selwyn , a sociologist at the london knowledge lab , of a 2006 study he conducted using students ' public facebook walls .
then there ' s the question of methodology .
on facebook , it ' s impossible to know how much of a user ' s profile information and wall posts are true .
which is why , despite his years as a technology researcher , selwyn thinks a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use .
" social research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still takes place offline . "
anders behring breivik , the man who confessed to masterminding twin attacks that killed 77 people in norway this summer , has described himself as a " resistance " fighter during his first public court appearance in oslo .
" i object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism . "
judge torkjel nesheim interrupted breivik during that monologue because he " did not want to give breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views . "
nesheim also ordered police to hold breivik in custody for 12 more weeks , banned him from accessing media for four weeks , and said that authorities will have tight control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks .
some came hoping to look breivik in the eye , others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key .
" i thought he seemed cold and inhuman , " one utoya survivor told norwegian broadcaster nrk .
dressed in a dark suit and blue tie , breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building .
it may comfort some that the july 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals .
" i wish he looked like a monster , but he doesn ' t , " a relative of one victim said .
7 lessons from the lost steve jobs interview , showing at a theater this week
but what apple fans might find most revealing in a recently rediscovered jobs interview dusted off in advance of special movie screenings in major markets this week , is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows .
back in 1995 , bob cringely was developing the tv series triumph of the nerds about the dawn of the personal computer , and he sat down for more than an hour with jobs for a rare , extended conversation .
while a small portion of cringely ' s interview was used in nerds , he says that the interview ' s master copies went missing in shipping .
this footage , slightly re - edited , is the basis of the 68 - minute steve jobs : the lost interview , coming to landmark theaters this wednesday and thursday .
and incredibly thoughtful .
there are also moments where jobs " perfectionism rises to the surface , where he seems impatient about cringely ' s questions , nudging him to move faster towards issues or subplots of greater import .
it ' s one thing to read posthumous appraisals of jobs " career , but there ' s something raw and inspiring about the jobs we see here , the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness .
not long after spelling it all out here he went and did it .
on how he learned to run a business :
nobody knows why they do what they do , nobody thinks about things very deeply in business .
jobs goes on to detail his efforts to streamline accounting at apple .
on pranking the pope :
the device has been widely written about before , but jobs " euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious .
" we were wrapping things around the globe a half dozen times and you would yell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door , " jobs says with a giggle .
us two , we didn ' t know much , but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson , and i don ' t think there would have ever been apple without it .
as various members of the catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the american diplomat , the two burst into giggles just before the pope himself was roused to come answer the phone .
at the age of 12 , on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter , he looked up bill hewlett in the phone book and gave him a call .
" that made a remarkable influence on me , it was the only company i had seen at that age and it formed my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees . "
it was as big as a suitcase , had a small cathode ray tube display , and i fell in love with it .
on improvising innovation :
early in his career , as he set out to sell a handful of circuit boards , he was asked by a customer to assemble the full computer .
later while at apple , he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse :
ninety days later , we had a mouse we could build for $ 15 that was incredibly reliable .
long before he led the revival of apple , jobs presciently foresaw the ways in which so many industry leaders would stumble in their vision , and lose control of their market share .
you have a monopoly of the market share , so the company ' s not more successful .
the product genius that led to that monopolistic position is rotted out by people who have no conception of good products vs . bad products - the craftsmanship required .
xerox could have owned the entire computer industry .
they grabbed defeat from victory .
" there ' s a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product . . . as you evolve that great idea , it changes and grows . "
there are tradeoffs you have to make - certain things you can ' t make electrons do , glass do , robots do , factories do .
ultimately it comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best stuff humans have done , and then trying to bring those things in to what you ' re doing .
we ' ve always been shameless about stealing great ideas .
if not for computer science , they would be doing amazing things in other fields .
the day the supreme court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to president obama ' s healthcare law , two of its justices , antonin scalia and clarence thomas , were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court .
one of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the sweeping healthcare overhaul passed by congress last year , a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists nationwide .
the lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be paul clement , who served as u . s . solicitor general during the george w . bush administration .
another firm that sponsored the dinner , jones day , represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law , the national federation of independent business .
the dinner was held at a washington hotel hours after the court ' s conference over the case .
the featured guests at the dinner ? scalia and thomas .
and it ' s nothing that runs afoul of ethics rules .
if they were , they arguably fell under code ' s canon 4c , which states , " a judge may attend fund - raising events of law - related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of honor , or featured on the program of such an event . "
" this stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code belies claims by several justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said bob edgar , the president of common cause .
their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .
and thomas " wife , ginni , is a high - profile conservative activist .
kagan served as solicitor general in the obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .
kagan has given no indication she will do so .
emirates airline orders 50 twin - aisle boeing 777 jetliners with an option for 20 more .
it ' s rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product .
just as big is where boeing got the order : the middle east , a growing gold mine of future airplane orders .
boeing over the weekend announced its biggest - ever order by dollar value for commercial airplanes - 50 twin - aisle boeing 777 jets .
the airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes , which would push the total list price to $ 26 billion , boeing announced at the 2011 dubai air show .
list price for six of those is more than $ 1 billion .
" the quality of these particular customers is pretty strong . "
so , not only do they have the money to pay for planes , but a surge in fuel prices - usually damaging to airlines because it ' s one of their biggest costs - is not as detrimental because the country is making money on the higher price of oil .
" they have a natural hedge , " he said .
boeing ' s win at the air show comes four months after airbus said it would push back the debut of the largest a350 , which competes directly with the 777-300er .
boeing co shares rose 1.5 % to $ 67.94.
luisa maria calderon alleges that drug traffickers helped opponent fausto vallejo of the pri in the governor ' s race .
preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to fausto vallejo of the institutional revolutionary party , or pri .
" they threatened our candidates , our poll workers . . . . they seized ballot boxes , set up roadblocks . . . and ordered people to vote " for the pri .
but it is staging a comeback , and victory in michoacan is an important step in that effort .
vallejo appears to have only narrowly edged out calderon , who had led polls before election day .
silvano aureoles , the candidate for the leftist democratic revolution party , or prd , which currently holds the governorship , came in third , a bad defeat for the divided and hapless left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote .
vallejo , former mayor of the state capital of morelia , denied ties to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results .
it is president calderon ' s home state , and he chose michoacan to launch a military - led offensive against traffickers in december 2006.
a pan mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for luisa maria calderon , and numerous candidates quit local races out of fear .
the man expected to represent the pri in the presidential race , enrique pena nieto , speaking from washington , congratulated vallejo and said , " i think this victory should be very encouraging , looking ahead to next year . "
the asian development bank has called for india and china to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long - term downturn that will stunt the growth of asian economies .
he warned against bric [ brazil , russia , india , china ] countries looking at europe ' s difficulties in a " dispassionate way " and said that asian financial assistance alongside european leadership and resources would help avoid a long - term breakdown in the global economy .
" so anybody who can help europe get out of the crisis is useful , " he told the financial times in an interview on the sidelines of the world economic forum in mumbai .
" so if china and india can help , by all means . "
in recent days , italy ' s borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of both italy and greece have resigned .
mr nag predicted that any asian support would be channelled through the imf , but said bilateral assistance - - like buying the bonds of the eu ' s bail - out fund , the european financial stability facility - - offered greater bargaining power to europe ' s asian partners .
" nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent , " he said .
" it is not an option , it is an imperative , because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women . "
ashutosh varshney , a professor at brown university in the us , said it would be politically very difficult to sell assistance to europe to india ' s 1.2bn people , of whom as many as 800m live on about $ 2 a day or less .
lee howell , the managing director of the world economic forum , likewise questioned why india ' s reserves should be used to keep greece ' s numerous and well - paid public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed , loss - making utilities like the railways .
the adb ' s forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in asia for 2011/12 now faced " risks on the downside " because of the threat from europe .
dire warnings from pentagon over potential defense cuts
the pentagon already is digesting $ 450 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional $ 600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if congress cannot reach a deal on spending .
he said that congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so - called sequestration would trigger 23 % across - the - board reductions and a halt to many new projects .
" we would also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel involuntarily and , because the reduction would be imposed so quickly , we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians in order to meet the target . "
the cuts would eventually hit combat troops , panetta said .
" contracting personnel would be cut , resulting in delays in the contracts and the contract oversight that support the war . "
the two senators had written panetta 10 days ago , asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the defense department .
" we are staunchly opposed to this draconian action , " the senators said in a joint statement monday afternoon when they released panetta ' s letter .
" the sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the united states , and it should not be allowed to occur . "
panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts , although he came to the top pentagon job with years of budget expertise himself in congress and the white house and knowing that he was facing tough choices .
" it ' s a ship without sailors . "
" it ' s an air wing without enough trained pilots . "
" it ' s a force that suffers low morale , poor readiness and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries . "
in an addendum to his letters to mccain and graham , panetta spelled out new specifics of how reductions " generate significant operational risks : delay response time to crises , conflicts , and disasters ; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world ; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations . "
that list included the f35 joint strike fighter , a planned new bomber , the next - generation ballistic submarine , the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the army and marines need to replace the humvee .
how to spot a lie
republican presidential candidate herman cain is busy trading allegations of sexual harassment with several women ; each side accuses the other of lying .
last week french president nicolas sarkozy was caught on an open microphone asserting to u . s . president barack obama that israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is a liar .
new york congressman and internet flasher anthony weiner made a fool of himself issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence .
and then again , no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus president bill clinton unleashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with monica lewinsky .
there have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews .
how much deceit do we encounter ?
now granted , many of those are white lies .
detecting lies , or " lie spotting , " is an essential skill for everyone to acquire , for both personal and professional reasons .
one result of the research is that most old myths about lying have been debunked .
they do not always stutter , stammer , blush or fidget .
a trained lie spotter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure , facial micro - expressions , question formation and timing .
good liars are skilled at reading others well , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them .
we also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer , others will feel less guilt in lying to you .
first , observe your subject ' s normal behavior .
it helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later .
you ' d better know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you don ' t make unjust accusations when you see foot - tapping in the middle of the meeting .
consider these clusters red flags , not proof of deception .
interrogators often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post - interview relief .
scott peterson famously slipped and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive , launching a nationwide search for her .
the most common verbal indicators are subtle .
this renders the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag .
these skills will enhance anyone ' s chances of avoiding victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal lives .
days after the obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from canada to the gulf of mexico - - angering unions while appeasing environmentalists - - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it ' s willing to reroute the project to get it back on track .
the company announced the decision at a news conference at the nebraska capitol .
that comes after the state department ' s announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the sandhills areas of nebraska and the ogallala aquifer , a vast underground water supply .
the new environmental review ordered by the state department likely would push off any decision until 2013 , after next year ' s elections , though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision .
the 1,700 - mile pipeline would extend from canada to the gulf of mexico .
to do so would require it crossing six states .
but nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the sand hills region and ogallala aquifer , a major source of drinking water and irrigation .
one is whether a lobbyist hired by transcanada , paul elliott , who was a campaign adviser to hillary clinton in 2008 , represents a conflict of interest for the program .
patti labelle sued for allegedly causing toddler to vomit out of fear
the " lady marmalade " singer ' s tirade frightened 18 - month - old genevieve monk so badly that she suffered " personality changes , sleep disorder " and " increased fear of strangers , " her family says in the manhattan supreme court suit .
while kevin monk got the car , roseanna monk came down to the lobby of their riverside boulevard building with their luggage , carrying genevieve .
" someone came up behind me and said , " do you know what your daughter is doing ? " i said " yes " and went to pick her up , " she said .
" she said in an aggressive tone , " you shouldn ' t have left your daughter by the door , " " roseanna monk said .
she became enraged and started using profanities - - the c - word and the f - word in a loud voice . . .
she said genevieve got hysterical .
labelle lunged at the mom - - who was still holding genevieve - - and had to be restrained by her entourage and pulled out to a waiting car , roseanna monk said .
later , the family sent a note asking for an apology from labelle but got no response .
the suit seeks unspecified damages , but the family ' s lawyer , sam davis , said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it gets to a children ' s cancer charity .
" that kind of behavior is completely unacceptable , especially when aimed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18 - month - old child . "
during the first year of mario lopez valdez management , in sinaloa increased the unemployment and the informality , foreign investment declined and the economy was reduced .
the low february temperatures , not only did they cause losses of millions for the agricultural sector , but they limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow , causing a contraction of the economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year , mainly supported by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture , which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors .
the fall in the economic activity has generated , until november , a constant increase of the unemployment in the state , according to the national institute of statistics and geography , the unemployment state rate during the first three quarters of the year registered an accelerated growth , from january to march 55.053 sinaloa habitants were unemployed , with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter , the rate became 5.28 percent , and between july and september the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent , a rate that in terms of the number of people represents more than 74.000 of unemployed sinaloa habitants , an increase compared to the first half of 18.969 individuals .
unemployment in sinaloa during the year is multi - factorial , for the economist gerardo lopez cervantes , director at the faculty of economics and social sciences of the uas , the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly , depending on the actions that the public policy has been taken .
stopped immigration
" the number of people who leaves the state in search of a job abroad , in the united states has been restricted , first of all due to the difficulties to enter , and second of all because once they enter they already have too many difficulties in finding a job , that group of people is staying and demanding jobs here , in the state , causing the rate of unemployment to rise , " he said .
the labor market analysis of sinaloa gets worse when considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions , according to inegi , 60.38 percent of the active population in the state works without being quoted as workers to any social security institution .
the monthly average income of sinaloa workers was , until september , 5.352 pesos , well below the national average , that is of 7.375 pesos .
in addition to the fall in economic activity and high unemployment rate , in 2011 there was recorded the largest decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years , according to the ministry of finance from january to june the state fdi totaled 630.697 dollars , which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5.143.312 dollars during the same period of last year .

miguel loredo lopez , president of the national chamber of transformation industry , said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of various sectors , including the state government itself .
economic slowness
" the low economic flow is the product of several events , including frost , one of the main effects has been a slow economy which does not turn fast enough for generating an economic dynamism that allows having an acceptable flow level of the processes , products and services and therefore , at the end of the year we are closing it below our expectations , " he said .
teodoro salazar uriarte , president of the employers " confederation of the mexican republic in sinaloa , said that the state is required to prosecute the most dynamic productive activities .
work to do
" overall i would say that the government has been striving to be successful in various fields , in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long - term program , " he said .
" there are elements that allow us saying that the government is becoming more inclusive , and what i can say is that there is work done and i think the government is aware that there is work to do , " he said .
five years in prison and a fine of 100 days was the sentence given to a navolato citizen for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana .
according to the record ap / sin / cln / 687/2010 / mi , valenzuela sandoval was arrested by the mexican army , the 7th of june 2010 , in a surveillance operation on the street cipriano valdez , in front of the post 80 in the town of el castillo , navolato .
for these reasons , the insured was put at the disposal of the second district court and the sentenced person continues to be a prisoner at the center for supporting the legal consequences of the crime .
the social works referred to in the programs such as habitat , rescue of public spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk not to be completed or to have serious delays due to the lack of funds , said miguel angel lopez miranda .
he noted that the total investment in these three programs is of nearly 50 million pesos , of which the state has to contribute with 25 percent and so far only the federation and the municipality have provided resources for the works , so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force .
he mentioned that last year , during the administration of jesus aguilar padilla , the state did not comply with the contributions it had to make , so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to borrow money in order to cover more than 7 million , a sum that was not provided on that occasion by the state administration .
although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources , he said that the request was made ​​to the secretary of administration and finance , armando villarreal , to speed up the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible .
the court validates " digital television transition " in mexico in 2015
the supreme court of justice ( scj ) rejected the constitutional controversies brought by the senate and house of representatives against the presidential decree that brings forward the so - called " digital television transition " from 2021 to 2015 , since the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not obtained .
with this result , the constitutional controversy promoted by the senate , was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree , and this remains in force .
only zaldivar , jorge mario pardo , margarita luna and sánchez cordero voted for the project .
at the ministers " meeting there was also decided to reject the claim filed by the chamber of deputies , without entering into the discussion of the project , also in charge of the minister sánchez cordero .
" nor do i consider that if made would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body , " and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive , who has a constitutional mandate , the guidance of the state .
delaying the change , he said , would mean delaying the benefits of digitization , which involves a public interest decision , which has not only a technical dimension , " as it covers economic , social , political and national security issues . "
he recalled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition , and has done it through the executive , despite of having highly specialized technical bodies .
they analyze the possibility of a " vote by vote " count in michoacán
the possibility of counting " vote by vote " is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in michoacán , where according to the data obtained from the preliminary electoral results program ( perp ) the difference between the first and the second place of the governor ' s election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes that correspond to 879 of the total 6.074 minutes .
as it will be recalled , michoacán did not authorize the constitution or the electoral code of the state or the electoral justice act , since the congress of the state approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the governor leonel godoy rangel omitted its publication within the periods specified in the law in the state official gazette , arguing that he had some objections .
interviewed about the possibility of the " vote by vote , " maria de los angeles llanderal stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the general council of the mei it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body .
in addition , the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting , is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates .
there should be noted that in this situation is the election of morelia , where according to perp the difference between the first and the second place is of just 0.16 percent , even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes .

the appointed prime minister , mario monti , will meet tomorrow with the president of italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster
a statement from the presidential palace announced that monti , named on sunday , will meet on wednesday with the president , giorgio napolitano , to confirm that he can form a government .
monti said the he will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government .
monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome .
monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days , much less than the normal , while italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels .
underlying the pressure on monti to hurry , the instable markets put the yield of the italian btp bonds to 10 - year above 7 percent , the level at which greece and ireland were forced to be rescued .
we believe that this government is the last chance for italy to get out of this emergency situation .
" we believe that the efforts of professor monti are destined to have a good outcome , " said to the reporters angelino alfano , secretary of the center - right party .
parliamentary support
any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets .
monti began on monday his consultations with the political parties , unions and business groups , as well as with youth and women organizations .
monti was appointed on sunday by napolitano , who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis .
rescuing italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the current financial defenses of the euro zone .
monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet , but the major parties insist that it must be made only of technicians , an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure .
the familiarity of the spanish is higher than that of the ticos
on the side of costa rica only one of 22 called players reached 50 games .
while the world and europe champions , number one in the monthly top of fifa , have a long record of class a inter selection , the tricolor has only the defender michael umana as the only one who has 50 international games .
spanish football players playing in the all - star league and in powerful clubs of the premier league of england are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and there are high - level shocks in the european cups and champions league .
the ticos players , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as concacaf , which is considered the lowest level within fifa
casillas will play today against the tricolor and will impose a new record of 127 international matches for spain .
casillas and xavi were recognized last week by uefa together with the other player of the iberian team , zubizarreta with 126 matches and schalke striker raul gonzalez with 102.
xabi alonso follows them with 91 , fernando torres , with 90 , david villa and sergio ramos , both with 81 , andres iniesta , with 62 , cesc fabregas , with 61 , and david silva , with 53.
after this , only five exceeded the 30 games : keilor navas with 31 , randall azofeifa with 32 , michael barrantes with 31 , carlos hernandez with 36 and jose luis lopez with 35.
more than 30 matches in spain have gerard piqué ( 37 ) , sergio busquets ( 36 ) , santiago santi cazorla ( 32 ) , alvaro arbeloa ( 31 ) and raul albiol ( 31 ) .
the rest doesn ' t come near the 20.

quintet included the country on the tour for celebrating two decades of experience
in an exclusive interview with viva , the bassist jeff ament , of pearl jam , said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next sunday at the national stadium .
this was stated by the bassist and founding member , jeff ament , who spoke exclusively with viva , from brazil , last week .
that day they will be present at the national stadium , starting at 7:30 pm , together with the band of los angeles the x and the band of the nationals las robertas .
for your followers from costa rica , is a dream come true that pearl jam will play in costa rica ? are you aware of what your fans are experiencing ?
this is only our second time in south and central america and so far has been great .
so we are excited to bring our music there .
what do you say to your most fervent followers ?
it took us almost 21 years to get to costa rica , thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here .
does this add a bit of pressure on your visit ?
we had a few wonderful shows in sao paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in costa rica .
we love this country , we love to surf and the jungle , for both things , costa rica is one of the best countries in the world .
we have many friends who are surfers and i have a great friend who lives in tamarindo and the waves here are incredible .
viewing the tour , one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs .
as we have never played there before , then we have no restrictions on what we can do .
you never repeat the repertoire .
i think it ' s partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs , so it ' s difficult to choose which songs to play every night .
that makes the show more interesting for us and therefore i think it also makes it more interesting for the people .
looking back , is it hard to believe all you have made ?
first , i think none of us could ever imagine we ' d be in a rock band and doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream .
we all love each other and love making music .
things could not be better for us .
it has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands .
it ' s amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual .
we are proud and honored to be part of the seattle group .
last year , we were at a festival with alice in chains and we were in canada with mudhoney , we saw soundgarden in its tour , so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of the seattle sound that aroused .
yes , four of us were together for 21 years and matt ( cameron ) joined us 13 years ago , which , by itself , is much longer than many bands lasted .
we are all very close friends and , thanks to this , there have also been opened musical avenues that give each the freedom to experiment .
your relationship to the word fame has not been easy ; but thanks to your success , you have been able to do whatever you wanted .
as we have grown , it has been easier to find a balance .
while one remembers that people are there for the music , that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it , without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star , something that none of us really cares about .
i think we write very good songs and at the beginning was a great thing .
there were many frustrations because lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of bruce ( fair - weather ) and greg ( gilmore ) , who started in the band with us and when i hear a song or see a picture i think of the incredible person that andy was and how he made ​​me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , laugh , talk about music and football and much more .
the national band las robertas will be responsible for opening the show in costa rica .
yes , the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most , so we ' re anxious to see what las robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining .
that is a question for ed ( eddie vedder ) , so i do not know .
as a bassist , what are your influences ?
within the first that come to my mind are geezer butler , john entwistle , c . j . ramone , john doe , paul mccartney , chuck dukowski . . .
how did pearl jam succeeded to maintain grunge relevant despite of not being any longer a fad ?
when i think of it , it reminds me of the bands i mentioned before , like mudhoney , soundgarden , nirvana and all that came at the same time , and if it is important now , i think it ' s wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as mudhoney are making now music better than ever .
how do you explain this change ?
with both , when ed played them , i cried when i heard them , and these songs are profoundly dark .
also , i think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark .

the invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building , balmes , 51
it seems that the nightmare lived by the neighbors residing in 51 balmes street has come to an end .
when the operation was finished the lock on the door was changed in order to prevent a repeat of the situation .
the squatters , who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building , the rest are inhabited - took all the wiring and part of the water , painted the walls and left residues of all kinds , especially alcoholic beverage cans .
next to the building there is a nightclub , balmes 51 , which has also been damaged .
the owner of the club says that the invaders of the farm made ​​her an unfair competition , since they were selling drinks for three euros , while in the club worth 10.
the head of the club said that the discomfort was so great that even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and there are now nine months since she " forgives " him for paying the rent .
the chairman of the pp municipal group , of the council alberto fernández díaz , had claimed last week " to immediately evacuate the building in order to solve the problems of coexistence and community spirit caused to neighbors , and the degradation of the area . "
in this sense , he added that " it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be strongly against the incivility that has been generated on the farm . "
at 15:30 the police went to 35 montral street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people had entered the building .
park or mountain ?
the municipal contest on the 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of collserola in barcelona
the booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan barcelona .
on the death of the mcb , in 1987 , the park was placed again in the minds of many , as the upper limit of barcelona , ​​being the catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north - south but up ( mountain ) - down ( sea ) .
the reference was not central park , but yellowstone , with the wild boar on the role of yogi bear .
a door refers to the idea of the park , no doubt .
the question comes alone : collserola ? park or mountain ?
it ' s almost a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lineage of elected persons recognize themselves in an elevator .
miguel roldan , daniel modolo and mara bayona : the competition is appropriate
" it should be assumed that the largest park in barcelona is the beach .
collserola is more complex , " says the architect to whom the title of " gates of collserola " contains a " lexical trap " : we should not think about them " as access to a park , but as the delimitation of some areas where we must act . "
hazards arising from the " uncertainty of projecting the public space " after the experience of the 80 " s which had in the forum area " his swan song . "
" limiting something is setting up the next step , " meaning , overcoming .
tighter to the question , modolo believes that simplifying the collserola valley side " can be understood as a park , barcelona , ​​not " by a purely topographical issue .
and further , understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate , but " he doubts " about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multidisciplinary teams ( " a success , " he points ) that have had to create : " the architects should be only a tool . "
this leads , at least in this case , to have chosen to participate in the 16 contests .
in your opinion , the council should ensure that the band immediately above the ronda de dalt should provide in its entirety , an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green .
after 72 days of arrangements , the legal representative of the red casino forgave the brother of the mayor of monterrey of the process against him for alleged extortion
after the bombing of casino royale , red casino owner , sergio gil garcia , made ​​public a series of photographs and videos where allegedly manuel jonas required him to pay an economic fee so that the city hall of monterrey allows the clandestine operation of the bet house .
after four hours before the agent of the public ministry for heritage crimes , he was transferred to the temporary jail , located in the old neighborhood of the state capital .
on october 19th he was transferred to cadereyta allegedly for blackmailing with a half million of pesos the owners of red casino , but he stayed there only a few hours in the medium - security prison because there were death threats against him .
on october 25th he an arrest order was issued by the clerk of second criminal district court , jorge yanez , who said that after nearly two months of inquiries there was enough evidence to establish the guilt of jonas , such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of it .
during the legal diligence , the public prosecutor attached to the court , ramiro arias , questioned garcia gomez whether he had repaired the damage and which of the partners of the betting house granted pardon , although the lawyer tried to reserve the name .
after the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmarkers , at almost 15:50 it was ordered the immediate release of larrazabal breton .
also he will notify him about the immediate release order issued by the judge .
the ministry of communications and transportation ( mct ) reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the interior secretary francisco blake mora , and seven others died , indicate that the helicopter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity , without the pilot attempting a forced landing .
" the elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the blades came into contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage . "
he also said that the investigations made ​​in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground .
" the design of the helicopter conceived for 19 passengers , fulfilled the appropriate requirements for transporting passengers .
for now , the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible ; however , the investigation may take several months or even one year .
" this information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact , " he said .

mss announces a protocol for finding obesity gene
the mexican social security institute ( mssi ) has announced that conducts a research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people , called the protocol of ' genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence ' , which will provide counting on markers associated with overweight .
the team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the national institute of public health ( niph ) and the centre for research and advanced studies ( cinvestav ) national polytechnic institute ( npi ) .
he stressed that the protocol started in the cuauhtémoc sports unit ( west mexico state ) and since october 8th , the activity takes place in the netzahualcoyotl sport unit ( east state of mexico ) .
he explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify in children and young mexicans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases .
they will also be asked about physical activity and family hereditary history of disease , in order to avoid risk factors that give rise to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure .
cruz lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children .
he said the justification for searching the markers is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic history .
he explained that generally , the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consume ( calories ) and which is stored as fat .
even , he said , the presence of dark - colored folds ( acanthuses ) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes .
cruz lopez explained that there are three major components that cause overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases : sedentary lifestyle , which is the lack of daily physical activity , staying most of the day and watching tv and using means of transport instead of walking short distances .
unam asphalt would avoid potholes
if the signals sent by the road surface were attended , it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the metropolitan area of valley of mexico , said rafael herrera najera , a researcher at the chemistry faculty ( cf ) of the unam , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate , the potholes could be reduced or even completely eliminated .
herrera nájera said that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot , as some cities in the north , to improve its performance and , therefore , the formation of potholes .
the viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees , it behaves like a liquid at 120 ° c , its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees celsius has a nearly solid state , whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile , he said .
cf researcher observed that the streets of mexico city are mostly covered by flexible pavement , which is composed of six layers of material , out of which the last three involve the asphalt .
each of the stones which compose this covering , he said , is dipped with asphalt .
if it were modified asphalt it would spread even better , said the chemical engineer .
since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle , it must have a better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and provide road friction .
the weather , especially humidity and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider , especially water , he said , because it greatly affects the performance of the asphalt .
in the formation of a pothole , he said , the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asphalt , but the damage does not happen instantly , it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs .
rafael herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asphalt , for example , asphalt emulsions , which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair potholes with easiness and without using high temperatures .
analysis of the factors that affected serna melina ramirez for not getting the crown of miss colombia .
once again cauca valley remains with the desire of the crown of miss colombia .
with the result obtained last night in cartagena , where miss atlantic won the crown and scepter , the department counts with 14 princess titles and melina joins the legion of women of valley of cauca who have been close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses , among them miriam ospina benoit ( 1947 ) , clara borrero dominguez ( 1949 ) , patricia bellini ayala ( 1979 ) , lorena álvarez ( 1981 ) , rose mary alzate ( 1983 ) , olga maria arenas ( 1987 ) , leila blanque ( 1988 ) , monica evers ( 1989 ) , maria consuela pinedo ( 1990 ) , diana isabel romero ( 1993 ) , giselle aljure garcés ( 2000 ) , catalina giraldo ( 2007 ) , stephanie garcés aljure ( 2008 ) .
what was missing ? because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new miss colombia , not in vain she was elected queen of the police and best jolie face of vogue , titles that were obtained by queens as taliana vargas or natalia navarro , who took the crown of miss colombia .
to the questioner she answered
today i read " crime and punishment ' it is a book of universal literature that we all should read ; and now i ' m reading the book by irene nemirovski , a russian , a beautiful book called " the heat of blood . '
but after the ceremony melina said she was calm and happy with the result " the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen . "
among the launched hypotheses it is said that valley got burned by favoritism .
and that was noted in her first appearance in swimsuit on the beach of hilton and during her two shows at the evening coronation .
ariel osorio , a journalist of the program " like home ' , of the rcn channel said that the fact that melina was designated as princess " means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the queen . "
another hypothesis is that valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work , which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest .
" beauty is not enough for a miss colombia , we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness , before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects , " she said .
the coach of the queens jorge hernán orozco recognizes that melina did not have the best body , that there were better , " but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen , which for me was not very noticeable , made her lose points the last day . "
" the surgeries are fine , but valley did not know how to do them .
for this award , which for the first time is given by the national beauty contest , after the swimsuit parade a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night , it was said that this was the flicker that raymundo granted to melina for not giving her the pleasure of taking the crown .
however , she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite her overwhelming passage through cartagena , found difficulties in getting the crown .
a cali lophoscopist entered into history as the man who confirmed the death of " alfonso cano .
on november 4th the lophoscopist of cali cti passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the farc top leader , " alfonso cano , through the comparison of his fingerprints .
at the beginning of his career , gonzalez worked in municipalities of chocó , where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be identified .
the week of eliazar ' s operation against alias alfonso cano he was warned to take clothes only for three days .
on friday night he went from cauca with a helicopter , to palmira .
however , when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was , he did not recognize him by his physical appearance ; it was very different from that seen in the media .
but the prints do not lie .
his eye did not fail him : it was " alfonso cano ' .
in search of the fingerprint
many people do not know our work .
apart from the identification of bodies , the fingerprinting specialists support research for crimes like theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured .
we will take their fingerprint and seek them in the database .
" the walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print , but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the offender , who had participated in several robberies " he said .
they have recently found a dead man , with liquor bottles around him .
although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer , it places him it in the murder scene .
when they appear there is used a paddle or tape to lift them .
" the problem is that there are still many undocumented colombians , " said cti expert .
just as not everything that glitters is gold , not everything you touch turns into a footprint .
the " angry persons " challenge the authorities in new york
a part of the protesters listened to the eviction order and moved to a nearby park .
hundreds of protesters crowded round the zuccotti square , where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order that allows " the angry persons " to camp on the site , while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park north the city where there have been made further arrests .
bray explained that the response of the " angry persons " to the evacuation of the camp issued personally by the mayor of new york , michael bloomberg , came to court , where judge lucy billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain camped .
at least for one hour they were able to occupy the place , but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters , although bray could not confirm the precise number , while telling efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed .
meanwhile , zuccotti square , which is a privately owned site , remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this tuesday in which to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning .
the court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of occupy wall street and enforce " laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit demonstrators regain access to the park with shops and other property used before . "
the councilman personally defended the evacuation of the zuccotti square carried out at dawn , an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and this was decided so because protesters were " violating the law . "
" the evacuation of this morning was disgusting and shows that deep inside bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of american workers , " added the spokesman of the movement , who accused the mayor of " disrespect for the freedom of expression . "

in addition to anderson and peters , the ctv christmas special show features the canadian singer buble , who at the end of march married in buenos aires the argentinean model luisana lopilato , and he is not a stranger as regards the controversy .
japan reborn after the earthquake
since last march , the japanese economy was paralyzed , still recovering from the devastating earthquake , resulting in a nuclear crisis , the worst catastrophe suffered by the nippon country since the second world war .
after three consecutive quarters of declines , the gross domestic product data between july and september helped to turn the page , definitely : gdp increased by 1.5 % compared to the previous quarter and by 6 % in annualized rate .
the recovery can be explained in part by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami .
however , the true revulsion of the japanese economy is not based exclusively on the keynesian impulse that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure , using of gaps to grow from scratch .
this variable climbed 1 % , driven by the increase of expenditure for cars , travels and leisure activities .
tokyo has entrusted to the internal market , when the yen - the nippon currency has become one of the " refuge values " chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the u . s . , a privilege that weighs like a stone in the accounts of export companies .
toyota or sony , for example , blamed the yen for their weak results between july and september .
" we must be vigilant to the risks that remain , such as the deterioration of some foreign economies , the impact of floods in thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , " said yesterday the secretary of state for economic policy , motohisa furukawa .
the organization for cooperation and economic development ( oecd ) said that most member countries showed in september clear signs of economic slowdown .
since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points , compared to 100.8 in august .
athens feeds back the doubts
with peripheral risk subsidies launched and uncertainty reinstated in the parks , greece is still entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great european debt crisis .
while the new prime minister , lukas papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be underestimated for applying them , the leader of the conservative new democracy party , antonis samaras , ensured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled on february 19th .
a package of 24 programs to boost employment , reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives .
the conservative leader was one step further in his pulse to the eu and the imf , the entities that must unfreeze the 8,000 million that athens urgently needed , and made ​​clear he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments .
the economic affairs spokesman , amadeu altafaj , said the troika inspectors would return " very soon " to athens to discuss with the new government " what has to be done to pay the sixth tranche " of 8,000 million , although there is no definite date .
mrs . sofia : " they are instruments of progress and hope "
spain " has achieved a prominent place worldwide in the role of microfinance . "
the queen opened yesterday the fifth global microcredit summit in valladolid with the belief that " there is no doubt " that such operations are " absolutely essential " to achieve the millennium goals set by the united nations for 2015 , and , " especially having as a goal halving the volume of people living with less than a dollar per day , with this fixing the " poverty line . "
there are " many achievements " and " many challenges we are facing . "
thus , his majesty explained that she hopes that at the end of 2015 , 175 million poor families will have acceded to these financial services and one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty in which they are immersed .
and she described the father of this tool as an " admirable idealist of the universal cause of the fight against poverty , " whose work is known for 15 years , when the queen went to bangladesh to find out in the field the policy of loans .
finally , the queen mrs . sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty .
foreign minister , trinidad jiménez , said that solidarity " is an ethical imperative " to every democratic state .
jimenez found that microcredit supposes " a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty , " and now " more than ever , " the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let this fall as victim of adjustments .
the secretary of state for international cooperation , soraya rodriguez , praised the " success " to give " trust " to people " excluded to whom all doors are closed , " and the mayor of valladolid , francisco javier leon de la riva , welcomed those present to a city that " opens its doors caught by the spirit of solidarity . "
the first day of the congress of the christian democratic union ( cdu ) on monday 14 november , in leipzig took place without any real problems arising for the chancellor angela merkel , who is also president of the christian democratic party .
the motion on the preidency of the european commission , tabled by the directorate , was adopted almost unanimously .
the standing ovation lasting several minutes which they , angela merkel and then a few hours later , wolfgang schäuble , the very europhile minister of finance , received at the end of their respective speeches , left no room for doubt .
not only because europe means peace , but because " nine million jobs depend directly on the euro . "
this could mean modifications of the treaty of lisbon , making it possible to strengthen the control by the european union of the budgetary policies of the countries of the eurozone , but this could also affect the election of the president of the european commission by universal suffrage " in order to impart a face to europe . "
certainly , it is not probable that the twenty - seven will rapidly agree to this solution ; great britain is opposed to it and the heads of cdu think that nicolas sarkozy is also opposed to it .
similarly , the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each country - member of the directorate of the european central bank according the size of its economy , which would clearly increase the weight of the german economy .
although the motion on europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of " franco - german friendship , " angela merkel did not mention france .
recalling that two centuries ago , leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle .
what is sick leave fraud ?
on 15 november , nicolas sarkozy will be in bordeaux to visit a family allowances allocation fund and to make a speech on this subject , which has been recurring since 2007 , concerning the fight against social assistance fraud .
first and foremost , with a view to budgetary economies , the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the start of unemployment benefit
a measure , which threatens to arouse anger , but which , according to les echos , would produce a saving of 280 million euros .
now that these questions are being discussed , the majority are also relaunching the subject of fraud , targeting abuses linked to medical certificates .
as in other cases , the effects of the announcement appear a little disproportionate to the reality of medical certificate - related fraud .
the french are no sicker than people elsewhere in europe .
according to the caisse nationale d ' assurance maladie ( cnam ) , over 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
of this sum , 46 % concerned maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 % sick leave benefit at 6,2 thousand million euros .
the french spent an average of 14,5 days on sick leave in 2010 , compared with 17.8 days in 2009 , according to a study by alma consulting group .
another study , this time concerning sickness insurances , states that in 2010 , 37 % of sick leave lasted less than 8 days , 15 % 15 days to one month , 15 % from one to three months and 11 % lasted longer .
a long study carried out in 2010 by two cnrs researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 , the global rate of absence from work in france ( for reasons of health or not ) fluctuated between 10 % and 11 % , compared with between 20 % and 28 % in denmark , 15 % in the united kingdom , or between 16 % and 18 % in the netherlands .
as regards fraud , it is very low .
in 2008 , out of 1,5 million controls , the cnam found that 13 % of the 285 000 controls on short - term sickness certificates were " unjustified , " or too long , " equal to 37 050 cases .
in total therefore , 169 000 cases were " unjustified , " out of several million of employees issued with certificates .
according to the ump deputy dominique tian , author of a report on the subject in june , this would represent 9 to 15 thousand million euros annual tax shortfall , equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infinitely higher than losses due to fraud .
greece needs a new programme of adjustment to rescue its economy .
" to pursue the efforts of rescuing the economy , we need the support of our european partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment " declared the head of government , who made his first public speech opening the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on wednesday .
consequently , m . papademos forecast that the country ' s public deficit would be reduced to " about 9 % " of the pib by the end of the year , after having been 10.6 % in 2010 and 15.7 % in 2009.
on monday , antonis samaras , the leader of the right , gave his support to already approved measures to try and emerge from the debt crisis , but warned that his party would not support additional austerity .
he declared his agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste , but also his opposition to any policy which would prevent economic recovery .
it is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide , says a committee of experts
regarding palliative medicine , the committee claims that governments , healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible palliative care , apart from cancer cases .
only 9 % of canadians agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end .
this committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code , so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision .
whilst canada is placed 10th , the study notes that " the medicalisation of death in canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject of death .
and 86 % of them end by dying in hospital
on the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide , the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the federal government , which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide .
on the contrary , affirmed during a teleconference , jocelyn downie , who submitted the report , more such cases were found precisely in those countries , where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised .
" assisted suicide is practised in canada , where it is clearly illegal , explains jocelyn downie .
it should be remembered that 85 % of canadians are in favour of euthanasia , because according to an angus reid enquiry in 2010 , they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering .
regarding persons who commit assisted suicide , investigations indicate that 41 % of such cases should not have been prosecuted .
they also suggest among their other recommendations , that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal .
regarding palliative care , the committee calls on governments , nursing institutions , and doctors to work together to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer .
reservations of other experts
maître pierre deschamps , a specialist in health legislation , described as " extreme " the position of the experts who signed the report , because among other things , it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to terminal cases .
me deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
the specialist in health legislation , margaret somerville also expressed " strong opposition to the conclusions of the report , which she described as being " obviously pro - euthanasia . "
the king of jordan calls on president assad to relinquish power
syria is becoming increasingly isolated
diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on the syria of bachar al - assad , who , with the support of russia , is resisting them and has denounced a " plot " against his country .
king abdallah ii of jordan yesterday became the first arab leader to call on president bachar al - assad to relinquish power in syria , where some forty civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed .
in his turn , the turkish foreign minister , ahmet davutoglu deplored the fact that turkish efforts to mediate , which began at the start of the year , did not meet with success .
for their part , the united states are congratulating themselves on the increased consensus against assad and the actions of the syrian regime following the decisions of the arab league and the european union .
during this time , 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime die in the area of deraa in the south of syria , announced l ' observatoire syrien des droits de l ' homme ( osdh ) .
during a press conference , the syrian foreign minister walid mouallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis . "
syria will not bend , he added , assuring that plots against syria would fail . "
the french foreign minister alain juppé also declared himself in favour to the dispatch of uno observers to help to protect civilians from repression by the regime , which according to him , is " paranoid . "
the russian foreign minister , sergyey lavrov , yesterday described as " incorrect " the decision of the arab league , whilst china exhorted syria to implement the plan of emerging from the crisis , taking care not to support possible sanctions against damascus .
monti demands time from the markets and sacrifices from italians
the former european commissioner was yesterday in discussions with the political parties before today ' s meeting with unions and employers
" monti spoke about an important programme involving a lot of sacrifices , " said francesco nucara , a deputy of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minister - designate .
the consultations will end in the presentation by m . monti of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of state , giorgio napolitano .
in a " democracy , time is needed for the preparation of a government and a programme , he stressed , adding that he was certain that the markets would be patient and understanding . "
the prime minister - designate had to form a team , most importantly comprising technocrats , even though he stressed that he would also like to include " politicians . "
according to the president of the chamber of deputies , gianfranco fini , the new government would secure the vote of confidence of parliament by friday .
a spokesman for the european commissioner , olli rehn . stressed that " regardless of a new government , our diagnostic of the italian economy has not changed . "
the italian " boss of bosses " emma marcegaglia , who will meet him on tuesday , has also insisted on the necessity of relaunching the economy , " because a country which does not have growth , cannot observe the parameters of deficit . "
the great unknown is the longevity of his team .
a russian scientist has assisted an iranian nuclear programme
the institute of science of international safety isis ) bases itself on the recent report from the international atomic safety agency ( aiea ) and other documents from this uno agency , to identify this researcher .
according to isis drawing largely on aiea documents , m . danilenko , born in 1934 , worked for 30 years from the ' sixties onward , in a soviet military nuclear centre in tcheliabinsk ( ural ) , and was involved in the manufacture by explosion of synthetic diamonds .
the economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the iranian embassy in ukraine in 1995.
in its last report , aiea mentions " strong indications that the development by iran " of a system of nuclear detonation " was aided by the work of a foreign expert , who not only knew this technique well , but who also informed the agency that he had worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin . "
between 2009 and 2010 , anti - moslem crimes increase by almost 50 % , whilst during the same period other forms of racial and religious violence had fallen slightly , or had not changed , according to fbi statistics published on monday .
the global number of hate crimes increased very slightly to 6 628 cases , of which 47,3 % were motivated by racial differences and 20 % by religious differences , according to fbi .
" human rights first has long stressed that acts of violence against moslems , as well as all forms of hate crime , must be regarded as serious violations of human rights , " adds one of the managers of the organisation , paul legendre .
" hate crime " in federal law , is a legacy from the period of struggle for civil rights .
twitter modifies its platform and resembles facebook
a new tab " activity " and another " name " make it possible to follow more legibly and directly the activity of other " twitters , " the internet navigators whose messages are monitored ( " tweets " ) and of those who monitor you .
this new twitter formula was tested " on a small percentage of users in august " before being broadcast to the entire network on monday , indicated a spokeswoman of twitter , carolyn penner to afp .
on the network , users debated this innovation via " tweets " on internet .
" the functionality activity will help me to monitor better certain elements of my twitter flow , " sent @ dannykronstrom .
inscription of a budgetary " golden rule " in the constitution
it was the social - democratic chancellor his elf , werner faymann , who announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the council of ministers , with the austrian public debt at 74,6 % , much higher than the norm of a maximum of 60 % set by the treaty of maastricht , but below the public debt of countries like italy , greece or spain .
austria thus complies with a request from the brussels summit of member - states of eurozone on 26 october ; the heads of state and government requested a reduction by the end of 2102 of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or in a law to the same effect .
by 2017 , the public structural deficit must fall by 0.75 % of the pib ) and from 2017 , the structural public deficit of the austrian federal state must not exceed 0,35 % of pib in any year , whilst the länder , as well as communities , must submit balanced budgets .
yoshihoko noda
the japanese prime minister , yoshihiko noda , warned on tuesday that the japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchanges market if the value of the yen continued to rise .
on tuesday , the yen rose to near historical levels , causing the japanese authorities to intervene on 31 october .
but the yen had risen regularly since then , stimulated by purchases by investors who regard it as a " shelter " in these uncertain times of worldwide economic slowdown and the debt crisis in europe .
prior to the financial crisis of 2008-2009 , the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen .
" japan is fighting to reconstruct itself " since the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 march , which devastated the region of tohoku ( north - east ) , stressed m . noda who fears that this rise of the yen does not kill the fragile embryonic recovery .
but the prime minister felt that the high price of the yen did to reflect " japan ' s economic fundamentals . "
but the deputy governor of the institution , hirohide yamaguchi , warned that the bank of japan had already taken steps the " appropriate steps " stating that no additional monetary flexibility was to be expected on wednesday
eurozone :
the risk of contagion of the debt crisis is undermining european indices .
still worried about the stability of eurozone , european exchanges have entered a little further into the negative area on this tuesday 15 november .
the dax at frankfurt fell 0,4 % and london 0,1 % .
" nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion , " explains terry pratt , an institutional broker at ig markets quoted by reuter .
" japan , like the rest of the world has its eyes riveted on europe and the exchanges will chase one another in a corridor of narrow variations as investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilised , " states mitsushige akino , fund manager at ichiyoshi investment management .
the euro is reaching its lowest level for a month and a half .
according to brokers , it fell after the party of the chancellor angela merkel , the cdu meeting on monday adopted a motion , envisaging , in particular , the possibility of a country in difficulty leaving the eurozone without also leaving the european union .
the borrowing rates of italy and spain remain at very disquieting levels .
these tensions of the rates of interest of southern countries , but also france , continue to feed the apprehensions of participants .
the new greek prime minister lucas papademos affirmed that the implementation of decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 october would be " the principal task " of his government .
the spread of the rate between 10 - year german and spanish bonds has reached a new historically high level .
france has recorded an economic growth of 0,4 % in the third quarter , a little better than the expected 0,3 % , due to increased household consumption .
and it is really the fourth quarter , which most disquiets the economists .
a first estimate in respect of the whole eurozone is expected at 11 a . m , the european commission having warned against the risk of a new recession .
facts must prevail over dogmas
the availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies .
the debate will not be fruitful , unless it explores all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .
now that we are 7 thousand million human beings on the planet , demographic development will involve a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050 , unless a huge proportion of the world ' s population is deprived of a vital element .
the fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters .
this is not the case of belgium , which subordinates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , or that of switzerland , which intends to build only the most modern ones .
the united states , decided after fukushima to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre , which was interrupted after the three mile island accident .
the choice of berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity , an increased energy dependence aggravated by increased recourse to imported gas , in particular from russia , a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres .
the case of denmark should be considered .
on the other hand , thanks to the constancy of energy policy , our neighbours pay 40 % more for their electricity than french households .
due to this , any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity , which would render illusory the fine declarations on re - industrialisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power .
it should be recalled that the energy policy of our country made it possible to establish an industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 resulting ones .
if france decided to abandon nuclear power , she would sacrifice a large number of these rme ' s and lose the annual 6 thousand million euro ' s worth of french exports of nuclear equipment and services .
to solve the energy equation , it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity .
for nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety , is absolutely vital .
our teams , whose professionalism is recognised , are accustomed to the same safety - related obsession .
only one , three mile island , occurred under normal operating conditions , but without any human or environmental consequences .
at fukushima , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people .
the fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities , the operators and french and german constructors , the epr presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena .
it is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country , but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion , dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate the debate , which is so decisive for the economic , social and financial situation of our country .
immigration policy under nicolas sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a congestion of police , legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self - proclaimed status of the country as the country of french human rights .
but it is only rarely analysed from the economic viewpoint .
on the right , the tone was set by jacques chirac , who declared in 1976 that " 900,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers , " and on the left by michel rocard explaining in 1990 that france " cannot accommodate all the world ' s misery . "
in 2005 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of polish plumbers was felt both on the left and on the right .
the only difference resides in the degree of generosity , which one deigns to grant to immigrants .
this notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very costly .
restraining immigration leads to anaemic growth and harms employment .
but experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to , rather than replacements of , local labour , exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labour .
a positive effect on wages
giovanni peri has calculated that a rise of 1 % in the migratory flow causes an increase of between 0,6 and 0,9 % in real long - term pay .
migrants are also net contributors to social systems , averaging 1 % of the total budgets of european countries .
nicolas sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth " with the teeth . "
europe invented democracy , thinks in terms of european democracy
the european continent should be able to remember that having invented it in athens over two thousand years ago , it experienced during the xxth century the tragedies of the world war , of totalitarisms , the holocaust , the gulag , but also franco in spain , salazar in portugal and the colonels in greece .
it is known that since the time of napoleon it was a matter of faculty of thinking .
no , democracy requires a lot more , a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and control of powers , education , the lumieres , economic and social solidarity , justice .
in this respect , the palinode of a true - false greek referendum will have a double revelatory value , that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy , but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its incongruity .
the truth is that the lines of the forefront of democratic struggle have now moved , and that for many , the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction .
the " free hand " of an absolute european monarch , or a jump with tied feet into the nationalist void ; what a choice for a citizen !
there are no crises in greece , italy , spain or portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them , because there is only a single crisis and that is in europe .
it is all europe , which is humiliated on the international scene .
the urgency concerns the return to popular sovereignty , the direction of the european project .
emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on european level , which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster .
let is be so .
we must launch a new stage of european construction .
the revolution of interests would not be enough .
we must construct a europe integrated on economic level .
to make europe , let us make europeans .
the worldwide chip map room opens on tuesday at villepinte near paris , in an optimistic atmosphere .
the most important sector is that of contactless technology , which enables paying for common transport or paying for purchases simply by passing the card over a reader .
their share will progress in 2012 ( 580 million units expected ) and represent almost 10 % of the global market of chip cards ( 6,925 million cards ) .
some 26 million visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75 000 payment terminals accept them .
but the large stores are installing superfast slots .
to achieve higher speeds , it is now necessary to equip their clients .
banks are testing payment by mobile telephone
few apparatus are at present equipped with nfc technology ( near field communication , essential for implementing these transactions .
" but they should really take wing next year . "
but the banks are forging ahead .
the iphones of some 200 clients and collaborators are going to be equipped to authorise contactless payment .
and the société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the market launch of an offer enabling its clients to pay via their mobiles .
paris is disquieted by links between the islamic maghreb and the boko haram sect .
on sunday , the algerian deputy foreign minister , abdelkader messahel , even stated that algiers is now certain .
paris appears to make a similar analysis .
the men kidnapped men in a restaurant in niamey by relatives of aqui , antoine de léocour and vincent delory had to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by special french forces .
terrorist axis
according to radio france internationale ( rfi ) , two numbers interest the investigators in particular ; one leads to a nigerian who lived for a long time in maiduguri , a town in northern nigeria , the cradle of boko haram and the other to a man said to be close to aqmi and to the sect .
" but it is possible . "
in recent months , this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by boko haram and from its methods of operation , which increasingly include resort to kamikazes and to increasingly complex explosive engines of the same type as those used by aqmi .
nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of enlightened persons not worthy of interest .
founded in 2002 at maiduguri around a mosque , a school and a fundamentalist imam mohammed yusuf , boko haram - which means in hausa " with western education " is a criminal , who promotes the installation of an islamic emirate in the moslem north of nigeria .
it is politicised and demands rigid respect of sharia , whilst its militants engage in a struggle with the impious central government .
in 2009 , the militants of boko haram showed themselves particularly active , multiplying attacks on police establishments .
the army surrounds a town and leaves 800 dead behind .
now the sect will become radicalised and will leave its northern fiefs .
in june at abuja , boko haram takes a secured police qg during a suicide attack , its first .
the creation of a terrorist axis in africa , which will move from mauritania to somalia via nigeria , now disquiets all security specialists .
last week during an interview in nigeria with president goodluck jonathan , alain juppé warned against boko haram and declared himself ready to share all intelligence .
concerning china , iran , aid to israel , mitt romney , herman cain , and rick perry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge .
to listen to republican presidential candidates , the electors might believe it .
concerning china , iran and aid to israel , the slogans , are often fused together .
so much the worse if this should trigger a trade war , he said .
he called for a muscular , but a constructive , dialogue with peking ( the current position of obama ) .
in the style of reagan
" if i am elected , i will stop iran , he trumpeted . "
hr also promised to increase military aid to israel , accusing obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner .
recently , he called for opposition to the chinese military threat , because peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that china has possessed it since 1964!
resort to the torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by obama in 2009 , is also recommended by cain , perry and by the candidate michele bachmann .
the opponents of the current president reply that reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war .
they insist with good reason on the setback of his naive dialogue with iran on the premature departure of the " boys " from iraq , his tergiversations in libya labelling him weak .
the population judges as positive obama ' s the balance of national security , which eliminated bin laden .
and in arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct america economically to revive its leadership , obama is right .
the north stream gasduct connecting western europe and russia directly along the bottom of the baltic sea , has been commissioned .
gazprom , the giant russian gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a " bang . "
symbolically , the german chancellor angela merkel , the russian president dmitri medvedev , the french prime minister françois fillon and his dutch opposite number mark rutte jointly turned the valve controlling the entry of russian gas into the west european network .
a second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 , making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire french consumption .
for gazprom , the completion on time of this huge project is a victory .
the north stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to germany , avoiding any passage via a third country ( poland or the ukraine ) .
at the most critical point of the debate , warsaw did not hesitate to compare north stream new " german - soviet pact , " referring to the alliance between hitler and stalin to occupy poland in 1939.
by supporting this russian project , western europe is gaining greater security for its supplies .
russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between russia and the the rich western countries , which consume large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are declining .
all this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of gazprom , present in large numbers at lubmin , the point of arrival of the gas .
the undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships ' anchors .
to construct it , it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the second world war .
it was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora .
a control platform was provided on the level of sweden , but the project managers abandoned it since the swedes were not keen on seeing a russian state company becoming permanently on its shores .
in the case of a leak , the gas contained in the gasduct therefore escapes into the air .
the surveillance of the state of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot , pulled by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct .
on arrival after 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second , it delivers precise information concerning any metal deformation .
the gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure .
five companies combined their forces to implement this project .
the others are the german companies e . on and basf ( 15.5 % each ) and the dutch gasunie and the french group gdf suez ( 9 % each ) .
it has its headquarters at zug in switzerland , where taxation is particularly favourable .
" gazprom will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , " states jens müller .
the total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million euros for the two pipelines .
but the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs , since gazprom assumes the entire risk .
4.5 metre high valves form the gas exit .
since last tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of russian gas every hour .
moleskine , a brand card .
it is a scent of adventure , of hours sent in writing by a the light of a candle .
nevertheless , the moleskine notebook as we know it today , was born in 1997.
maria sebregondi , then a consultant of the company , has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product .
this type of notebook is said to be highly prized by writers and travellers .
success is there .
one has travelled far from the production of the first years , when only 3000 notebooks were made .
it is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser , because the notebook attracts equally a businessman , a student and a professional .
the small italian company , which had only 12 employees at the start , now has almost 100 and two offices , one in milan and the other in new york .
" we followed the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing , notwithstanding the rise of e - mail , " explains maria sebregondi .
in august , it also launched a leopardskin pattern cover on the occasion of the film festival in locarno .
a success , which aroused envy ; in the autumn of 2006 , modo modo was bought by the investment fund sg capital europe , now syntegra capital , to write a new page in the history of moleskine .
some 19 % of handicapped persons are looking for work .
despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005 , the rate of unemployment of the handicapped is still twice as high as the average , namely 19 % , versus 9 % for the population as a whole .
" no , stresses eric blanchet , director - general of adapt , the association which organises the week for the employment of the handicapped . "
" at that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as high . "
it must be said that for the handicapped , the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many .
they have rather a low level of qualifications ; 80 % do not have the " bac " and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education only 10 000 are handicapped .
briefly , all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the nub of the problem , " according to christian grapin , director - general of tremplin , an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit handicapped workers .
it is hardly necessary to speak about mentalities , which do change , but too slowly .
result - private companies employing over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of employing the 6 % of handicapped workers , fixed by a law dating back to 1987.
" we are now on around 3 % , " says pierre blanc , director - general of the agefiph , the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law .
" the law of 2005 , which raised the contributions , created a strong pressure on companies , explains pierre blanc . "
according to the ministry of employment , only 59 % of establishments employing between 20 and 49 handicapped persons , versus 82 % of companies employing between 100 and 199 persons .
before facing the blues on tuesday evening ( 20.45 hrs ) eden hazard and georges leekens did not hide the pleasure , which this friendly match gave to them .
sitting side by side on the tribune of the auditorium of the stade de france , georges leekens and eden hazard made peace .
" i am very pleased with eden , his progress and the fact that he is belgian . "
in contrast between his respective club and selection performances , " it is of a piece if it is justified . "
" i must take my marks . "
not however forgetting the notion of " pleasing . "
" i always supported them , he affirms .
all the more so , since opposite are mathieu ( debuchy ) , yohan ( cabaye ) and adil ( rami ) , " he recalls .
" to be able to play against them , that is pure happiness ! "
" pride " of playing in " a gala match . "
" laurent blanc was a thunderbolt , he enthuses .
" our little belgians become big , " he stressed .
" you will realise this during the matches to come . including that against france .
the portugal of paulo bento starts its return match against bosnia ( 22h00 ) very optimistically , this tuesday in lisbon .
" at the end of these 90 minutes , we will be a happy team and most importantly , a happy country . "
for him there is not a shadow of a doubt , the selection , with which he has been at odds since september 2010 , will qualify for euro 2012.
but there is match to play and an opponent , bosnia to conquer .
whilst portugal dominated the match for over one hour , it was not able to reach this precious target , which would have consoled it .
but on their side , in their illuminated stade de la luz in lisbon , the portuguese are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic , even if the match is very close , " said an optimistic , but lucid , bento
" we continue to have a 50 % chance of being at euro 2012 , " even under the successor of carlos queiroz .
a zero may be sufficient for the bosnians .
" we are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players possessing many individual qualities , " he added .
a good idea , provided that it will , prove realistic this time .
