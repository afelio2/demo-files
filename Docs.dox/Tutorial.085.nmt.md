Neural Machine Translation {#nmt}
=================================

This section describes how to prepare lattices and RTNs produced by ucam-smt for
our neural machine translation (NMT) tool
using them in combination with 
[SGNMT tool](http://ucam-smt.github.io/sgnmt/html/) 
[\ref Stahlberg2016] which is an extension of the NMT implementation in the 
[blocks](http://blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
framework. SGNMT supports lattice, RTN, and n-best rescoring with single
or ensembled NMT, integration of language models and much more. Examples can
be found on the [SGNMT tutorial page](http://ucam-smt.github.io/sgnmt/html/tutorial.html).
