Neural Machine Translation {#nmt}
=================================

This section describes how to use ucam-smt in combination with 
neural machine translation (NMT). Large parts of this tutorial are
based on the
[SGNMT tool](http://www.example.org/) 
[\ref Stahlberg2016] which is an extension of the NMT implementation in the 
[blocks](http://blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
framework. SGNMT supports lattice, RTN, and n-best rescoring with single
or ensembled NMT, integration of language models and much more.
