Installation {#build}
=====================

This section contains instructions on downloading, compiling, and
installing the UCAM-SMT tools.  

There are three sets of tools that can be installed:

   * \ref install_binaries --  HiFST C++ binaries and dependencies (OpenFst, KenLM, ...)
   * \ref tutorial_install -- HiFST tutorial based on the UCAM WMT'13 Russian-English system [\ref Pino2013]
   * \ref rulextract_install -- Hadoop-based translation grammar extraction

The \ref install_binaries is **required** to run the \ref
tutorial_. However the \ref tutorial_ does **not require** the
translation grammar - translation grammars, language models, etc., are
provided in the tutorial.  However, the Hadoop-based translation
grammar extraction may be useful if you wish to extract your own
translation grammars from aligned parallel text.

\section install_binaries HiFST Binary Installation

**Note**:The following instructions are for the Bash shell.

The code can be cloned from the following GitHub address:

    > git clone https://github.com/ucam-smt/ucam-smt.git

In the following, `HiFSTROOT` designates the cloned directory,
i.e. the following should be a complete path to the cloned directory

    > export HiFSTROOT=complete_path_to_hifst_cloned_directory

As a check, the following command should find the `README.md` file downloaded from github:

    > ls $HiFSTROOT/README.md

Once downloaded, the tools and libraries are compiled in the directory
`$HiFSTROOT` by running the script `build-test.sh`.  

**Note** that the
environment variable `TGTBINMK` specific compilation option
(e.g. optimisation level, static vs dynamic, etc.).  See
`build-test.sh` for the supported options; the default is `export TGTBINMK=O2`.

    > cd $HiFSTROOT
    > export TGTBINMK=O2 # change this as appropriate for your environment
    > ./build-test.sh

This should download and install necessary dependencies,
compile the code and run tests. The `README.md` in the cloned directory also
contains useful information for the installation.

\section hifst_paths HiFST Paths and Environment Variables

After HiFST is successfully built and tested,  the file $HiFSTROOT/Makefile.inc
will contain environment variable settings needed to run the HiFST
binaries and the OpenFST tools using the HiFST libraries.  To set these,
simply run

    > source $HiFSTROOT/Makefile.inc
    > export PATH=$HiFSTROOT/bin:$OPENFST_BIN:$PATH
    > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HiFSTROOT/bin:$OPENFST_LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

You should make sure that $HiFSTBINDIR is added first on the path and
the library path and that it preceeds the OpenFst directories.
If the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH variable is not set correctly, you will see the message

    ERROR: GenericRegister::GetEntry : tropical_LT_tropical-arc.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    ERROR: ReadFst : unknown arc type "tropical_LT_tropical" : standard input

Sourcing `Makefile.inc` sets the environment variable 
`TGTBINMK` to point to the HiFST binaries; for example, the following should find the main HiFST binary:

   > ls $HiFSTROOT/bin/hifst.${TGTBINMK}.bin

It is possible to use multiple builds of HiFST by changing the `TGTBINMK` variable.

\section rulextract_install Installation of the Hadoop-based Grammar Extraction Tools
**Note:** These are not needed to run the basic HiFST \ref tutorial_.

Requirements for building/running the rule extraction code:
  + an Internet connection
  + preferably 64-bit linux
  + [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
  + java 1.7+

If you don't know how to install sbt, here's one way to do it
on Ubuntu:

    > wget http://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian/sbt-0.13.5.deb
    > sudo dpkg -i sbt-0.13.5.deb

If you're not root or sudo, you can follow these
[instructions](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Manual-Installation.html)

If you don't know how to install java, here's one way to install
java 7 on Ubuntu, as described
[here](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html) (for java 8, see [here](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html)):

    > sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    > sudo apt-get update
    > sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

If you're not root or sudo, simply download
JDK and update the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME`
accordingly.

**Note**: the java version used to run your Hadoop cluster should be
greater or equal to the java version used to compile the code; otherwise
you may get an "Unsupported major.minor version" error.

The rule extraction code will be in the `$HiFSTROOT/java/ruleXtract`
directory. The variable `$RULEXTRACT` designates this directory
from now on:

    RULEXTRACT=$HiFSTROOT/java/ruleXtract

To build the rule extraction software, simply run the
following commands:

    > cd $RULEXTRACT
    > sbt package

You will obtain a jar file named `ruleXtract.jar`
located at `$RULEXTRACT/target/ruleXtract.jar` .
The variable `$RULEXTRACTJAR` designates this
jar from now on:

    > RULEXTRACTJAR=$RULEXTRACT/target/ruleXtract.jar

To run unit tests, simply run:

    > cd $RULEXTRACT
    > sbt test

If all goes well, you should see a similar looking output:

    [info] Passed: Total 1, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 1
    [success] Total time: 3 s, completed 12-Aug-2014 10:49:51


\section tutorial_install Tutorial Installation

Files for this tutorial can be downloaded from the following GitHub address:

    > git clone https://github.com/ucam-smt/demo-files.git
    > cd demo-files; gunzip wmaps/*.gz  ## Uncompress big wordmap files.

**Supplementary Files** There are additional files which can be
downloaded from
<http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~wjb31/data/hifst.release.May14/> .  These
are large grammars and language models to be used to replicate
evaluation results.  They're needed for some of the tutorial steps,
e.g. MERT, but aren't included in the default tutorial downloads, due
to their size.

The tutorial files and sources for this tutorial will be
in the `demo-files` directory. The variable `$DEMO`
designates this directory from now on. As an optional
step, if you wish to regenerate the HTML code for this
tutorial, make sure you have doxygen (1.8+
for markdown support) and
latex (for formulas) installed and run the following commands:

    > cd $DEMO/Docs.dox
    > doxygen

For this tutorial, it is assumed that rule extraction commands
are run from the `$DEMO` directory:

    > cd $DEMO
