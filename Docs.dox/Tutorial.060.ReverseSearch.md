Multi-dimensional MERT {#rsearch}
=================================

This section describes how to perform a multi-dimensional reverse
search [\ref Fukuda2004, \ref Waite2014, \ref Waite2015] over 
N-best lists.  Quoting from the abstract of [\ref Waite2015], multi-dimensional MERT is

   > ... a polynomial-time generalisation of line optimisation that
   > computes the error surface over a plane embedded in parameter
   > space. The description of this algorithm relies on convex
   > geometry, which is the mathematics of polytopes and their faces.

Chapters 5 and 6 of [\ref Waite2014] give a complete presentation of
the underlying theory.  This tutorial reviews the procedure used to
carry out the two-dimensional MERT described in Section 4.2 of [\ref
Waite2015] and Section 6.4 of [\ref Waite2014].  This second reference also
explains some of the steps that are carried out within the procedure.

For this example we
use the reverse search implementation of C. Weibel 
[\ref Weibel2010]. Because his implementation has a GPL license it must be
downloaded and compiled separately. The version used in the following
example is
[1.6.2f](https://sites.google.com/site/christopheweibel/research/minksum/MINKSUM_1.6.2f.tar.gz?attredirects=0). 
**The scripts used in the example assume that the shell variable $MINK_SUM
points to the bin directory of this tool.**

The following script will perform a mulit-dimensional MERT over 150 sentences.
*N.B.* Before running reverse search it is necessary to generate the N-Best lists.  
To do this,  follow Steps 1, 2, and 3 in the tutorial section \ref mert with `M=150`, and then run

    > scripts/reverse_search.sh

Let us examine the key steps in this script. 

\section affine_project Step 1. Feature Projection

Multi-dimensional MERT casts the line optimisation procedure as the
affine projection of a linear space to a lower dimensional affine
subspace. Within this lower dimensional affine subspace it is possible
to use the reverse search algorithm to enumerate each set of
hypotheses that can generated from the N-best lists.
For this example a 3-dimensional affine subspace is constructed where
the first feature dimension is the affine component, and the other two
features map to the second `f_1(e)` and fourth `f_3(e)` features in the
feature vectors `F(e)` contained in the N-best lists.  
The projection is performed as described in [\ref Waite2014, Section
6.4].  The initial parameter value, \f$w^{(0)}\f$ is the 12-dimensional
parameter vector used to generate the N-best list (see
`configs/CF.mert.hyps` and \ref weight_feature_vector_examples).  

A `3x12` dimensional matrix \f$A_{3,12}\f$ is formed from \f$w^{(0)}\f$ as described in [\ref
Waite2014, Section 6.4] so that any 12-dimensional feature vector \f$f\f$
can be projected into the subspace as \f$A_{3,12} f\f$.  This is done using the following script:

    > zcat output/exp.mert/nbest/VECFEA/1.vecfea.gz  | ./scripts/affine_project.py $FW
    [
    [[-48.2233,-10.8672,16.0000],[-47.3144,-12.8613,17.0000],[-50.7771,-9.6670,16.0000], ...

The output format is required by the reverse search implementation and
consists of 3-dimensional row vectors. In this example there are 100
vectors, one for each entry in the 100-best list.    
The reverse search algorithm requires a well known starting parameter
to begin its search, and the implementation uses the parameter 
\f$[1,1,1]\f$ as its starting point.   However we wish the search procedure to start from the projection of \f$w^{(0)}\f$. 
To enforce this,  the affine projection script subtracts 1 from the second and
fourth parameter to force the reverse search implementation to use the
starting parameter `[1,0,0]`. The affine projection script also negates
the feature vectors because the convention of reverse search is to
maximise scores, as opposed to the cost minimization convention of
HiFST.

\section convex_hull Step 2. Convex Hulls of Projected Features

The following line computes the convex hull from the set of projected feature vectors. This is performed separately for each N-Best list:

    > SETSIZE=150
    > for i in `seq 1 $SETSIZE`; do cat output/exp.mert/polytope/$i.txt | $MINK_SUM/convexHull -d > output/exp.mert/hull/$i.txt;done

The result is a filtered set of feature vectors that form vertices of
the convex hull for each sentence. Since any input feature vector that is an interior point is discarded, these files  are shorter than the original N-best lists.
These vertices are then compiled
into an single file for input into the reverse search tool.

\section reverse_search_op Step 3. Reverse Search

The reverse search is performed as follows:

    > mkdir -p output/exp.mert/reverse_search
    > cd output/exp.mert/reverse_search
    > $MINK_SUM/minkSumForkGrid -c -n 12  < ../minksumin.txt 

The `-c` option instructs the reverse search tool to compute the full
normal cone associated with each result. This option can be omitted
for faster computation.

The `-n 12` option is the number of child processes to be used for
parallel computation. In this case 12 are spawned. 

The output of the tool is contained in the directory
`output/exp.mert/reverse_search`. In this directory is an output file
for each child process. Each line is these output files corresponds to
a normal cone. Let us examine one line from an output file

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

This line is divided into four fields separated by the colon character `:`

- The first field represents the set of hypotheses maximised by the parameters in this cone. It is a vector of 150 elements, with each element corresponding to an index to a vertex in the convex hull associated with each input sentence
- The second field is the sum of all the vertices
- The third field is a parameter interior to the normal cone which maximises all the vertices in the first field
- The fourth field is an optional field associated with the `-c` option. It is the set of rays that define the cone 

The parameter vector (the third field) can be used to rescore the
N-Best lists by their projected feature vectors: each
parameter vector will return the hypotheses identified by the first
field (barring numerical errors).   

Due to the geometry of a normal cone,  the parameter vectors can be mapped from 3 to 12 dimensions, as follows:
- Parameter vectors for which the first element of the parameter vector is negative are rejected
- The parameter vector is scaled by the first element (\f$f_i \leftarrow f_i / f_1\f$) 
- A new 12-dimensional parameter vector is created by adding the second and third element of the scaled projected feature vector to the second and fourth elements of the initial parameter

\section reverse_search_reranking Step 4. Reranking

Once the reverse search is complete, we should complete a sanity test
to ensure that the parameters found by the reverse search correctly
rerank the N-best lists. 

The first step is to map the vertices in the
convex hull to the feature vectors in the original N-best list.

    > scripts/map_vertices.py output/exp.mert/polytope output/exp.mert/hull > output/exp.mert/mapping.txt

The result of this script is a pickled python map object that provides
the mapping between index of a vertex in a convex hull to the index of
the corresponding feature vector in the N-best list. Using this
mapping between convex hull and the indices of the N-best list, the sanity test is
executed by the following script:

    > cat output/exp.mert/reverse_search/result.* |\
    scripts/reverse_search_test.py output/exp.mert/mapping.txt output/exp.mert/nbest/VECFEA $GW > log/log.reverse.search.sanity

The 3-dimensional parameter vectors found by the reverse search are mapped up to 12 dimensions (as described above) and used 
to re-rank the 150 N-best lists. The index of the top scoring hypotheses of the reranked
lists should match the mapped index from the first field of the
reverse search output. If the indices do not match, the sanity test
script prints a line of the form:

    Discrepancy! For input sentence 31 featue vector 2 is the top scorer

Due to floating point errors there will be some N-best lists that are
reranked incorrectly. 
For reference, using 150 input sentences with 100-best lists generated
346,526 parameters. Of these parameters 185,475 were accepted for
testing (i.e. had \f$f_1 > 0\f$), which means that 27,821,250 (=150 * 185,475) reranking tests were
performed. Out of these tests 28,282 rerankings had the wrong top
scoring hypothesis, which is approximately 1% of all the reranking
tests performed.
