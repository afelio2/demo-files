\section Setup_configs Configuration Files and Command Line Options

HiFST uses the Boost libraries which provide support for command line options and 
[configuration files](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/program_options/overview.html).
For example, the
following options could be provided on the command line:

     --hifst.prune=9 --hifst.replacefstbyarc.nonterminals=X,V

Alternatively, they could be specified in a configuration file either as

     hifst.prune=9
     hifst.replacefstbyarc.nonterminals=X,V

or as

     [hifst]
     prune=9
     replacefstbyarc.nonterminals=X,V

As you work through the tutorial, please read the comments in the
config files which explain some of the processing options.  For example, see `configs/CF.baseline`:

\section wmaps Word Maps

HiFST uses [symbol tables](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstAdvancedUsage#Symbol_Tables)
as provided by \ref OpenFst to map between source and target
language text and the integer representation used internally by
the decoder.  See the \ref OpenFst [Quick Tour](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstQuickTour) for a
discussion of the use of symbol tables.  

Integer mappings for English and Russian are in the directory wmaps/ :

     wmaps/wmt13.en.wmap
     wmaps/wmt13.ru.wmap

Note that HiFST reserves the integers `1` and `2` for the sentence-start and sentence-end symbols.  `0` is the \ref OpenFst epsilon symbol.  `999999998` is the OOV symbol.

The format of the wordmap files is straightforward, e.g.

     > head wmaps/wmt13.en.wmap
     <epsilon>		      0
     <s>		      1
     </s>		      2
     the		      3
     ,			      4
     .			      5
     of			      6
     to			      7
     and		      8
     in			      9

\section wmappedfiles Integer-Mapped Text Files

Source text files are provided in integer format :

     > head -1 RU/RU.tune.idx
     1 3526 10 1278 28847 3 64570 1857 7786 2

The \ref OpenFst [FAR](http://openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstExtensions) tools can be used to generate Russian text from the integer mapped files (see \ref basic_latshyps).

     > farcompilestrings --entry_type=line RU/RU.tune.idx | farprintstrings --symbols=wmaps/wmt13.ru.wmap | head -1
     <s> парламент не поддерживает поправку , дающую свободу тимошенко </s>


\section lms Language Models

English language models are provided in both
[KenLM](http://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) and
[ARPA](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/manpages/ngram-format.5.html)
formats .  See [\ref Pino2013] for a description of how these LMs are built.

Language models are in integer mapped format, e.g. for the ARPA files:

      > zcat M/lm.tc.gz | head -15

      \data\
      ngram 1=2794
      ngram 2=181413
      ngram 3=292841

      \1-grams:
      -2.153572  10 -0.8350325
      -4.555545  100  -0.5700829
      -4.174318  1000 -0.9515274
      -3.82578 1001 -1.104666
      -5.726784  10013     -0.2537366
      -6.726784  100231    -0.2309253
      -4.027669  1004 -0.9985322
      -4.362545  1009 -0.7841078

The integers correspond to words in the English wordmap file `wmaps/wmt13.en.wmap`.


\section tgrammars Translation Grammars
HiFST uses Synchronous Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) for translation.
A full Hiero and a Shallow-1 translation grammar are provided in the `G/` directory:

     G/rules.shallow.gz : Shallow-1 hiero grammar with scalar scores

We also provide a grammar with raw, unweighted feature vectors:

     G/rules.shallow.vecfea.gz : Shallow-1 hiero grammar with feature vectors

There is also a grammar provided for the true-casing example (\ref true_casing)

      G/tc.unimap

\subsection rules Grammar File Formats

In the grammar file, each line represents a rule. The rule format is:

     LHS RHS_SOURCE RHS_TARGET FEA_1 [FEA_2 FEA_3 FEA_4 ...]

where

     LHS = the left hand side of the rule
     RHS_SOURCE = the source-language part of the right hand side of the rule
     RHS_TARGET = the target-language part of the right hand side of the rule
     FEA_i = the i-th component of the feature vector associated with the rule

The left hand side of a rule is a non-terminal symbol (in uppercase).
The right hand side is a pair of terminal and non-terminal
symbol sequences in the source and target languages.  

\subsection tgrammars_formats_fea Feature Vectors

Scores are assigned to rules as the dot product of a rule-specific feature vector
and a weight vector ([\ref Chiang2007] and see the discussion in \ref lmert).  This
computation can be done offline, in which case the feature for every rule in the grammar is a
1-dimensional scalar. Alternatively, the decoder can be provided with a weight vector which is applied
to the feature vectors while loading the grammar.
For example, the grammar `G/rules.shallow.gz` provided in this tutorial the following set of weights was found via LMERT tuning (\ref lmert ):

    0.697263,0.396540,2.270819,-0.145200,0.038503,29.518480,-3.411896,-3.732196,0.217455,0.041551,0.060136

These can be applied to the Shallow-1 grammar, as follows:

    > gzip -d -c G/rules.shallow.vecfea.gz | head -3
    V 3 4 0.223527 0.116794 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 -1 1.268789 0.687159
    V 3 4_3 3.333756 0.338107 -2 -1 0 0 0 0 -1 1.662178 3.363062
    V 3 8 3.74095 3.279819 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 -1 3.741382 2.271445

    > GW=0.697263,0.396540,2.270819,-0.145200,0.038503,29.518480,-3.411896,-3.732196,0.217455,0.041551,0.060136

    > zcat G/rules.shallow.vecfea.gz | scripts/weightgrammar -w=$GW | head -3
    V 3 4 -2.046860955276
    V 3 4_3 -1.884009085882
    V 3 8 1.857985226112

and this should agree with the scalar-valued version of the grammar:

    > zcat G/rules.shallow.gz | head -3
    V 3 4 -2.046860955276
    V 3 4_3 -1.884009085882
    V 3 8 1.857985226112

**Note** that the unweighted feature vector contains all features
  needed to compute the score of a translation, *except* for the
  contributions from the language model(s).


\subsection tgrammars_formats_nt Non-Terminals

In translation, a non-terminal `X` on the right hand side can be
rewritten by any rule whose left hand side is `X`. HiFST places
no restrictions on the definition of terminal and non-terminal
sequences in an SCFG rule; similarly, there are no constraints on how
many non-terminal symbols can be used in a rule (i.e. there are no constraints on order of the
SCFG).  However using a full Hiero grammar can lead to slow
translation, and this tutorial discusses several strategies for
pruning in translation and for translation grammar pruning.

Here is a small sample translation grammar

     M 434_M 1462_8_M -1.81842
     M 7_M 9_3_M -0.735445
     M V V -0
     S S_X S_X 0.05768
     S X X -0
     V 10806 1411 1.16623
     V 164_M_60 78_M_8 -0.226464
     V 164_M2_60_M1 78_M1_8_M2 -0.226464
     V 21_591 39_258_8 -0.510102
     V 24 3_54 -2.50252
     V 274_M_4 709_9_3_M -0.589246
     V 5 6 -1.81729
     V 7_1689 9_741_8 0.438945
     V 8 23 -1.46604
     X 1 1 -2.5598
     X 2 2 -2.5598
     X V V -0
     D 1775 <dr> 10.4327
     S S_D_X S_D_X 0.11536


This grammar has four non-terminal symbols: `S`, `M`, `V` and `D`, and a 1-dimensional weight.  The terminal symbols are integers, corresponding to words in the source and target language word maps (\ref wmaps).  The symbol  `<dr>`
is a special symbol used by HiFST to represent an empty word, to indicate deletion.


As an example, for rule

     V 164_M_60 78_M_8 -0.226464

we have

     LHS        = V
     RHS_SOURCE = 164_M_60
     RHS_TARGET = 78_M_8
     WEIGHT_1   = -0.226464

With this rule the decoder can rewrite the non-terminal `V` by replacing it by `164_M_60`
in the source language and by `78_M_8`
in the target language;  the rule is applied with
a score of -0.226464. Similarly, rule `V 5 6 -1.81729`
replaces `V` by the word "5" in the source-language and with the word
"6" in the target-language, with a score of -1.81729.

Indices on non-terminals indicate alignment within rules with more than one non-terminal. For example, for rule

    V 164_M2_6_M1 78_M1_8_M2 -0.226464

the `M` non-terminals on both language sides are indexed by 1 or 2; that is, `M1` in the source
language is linked with `M1` in the target language, and `M2` in the
source language is linked with `M2` in the target.
Strictly speaking, `M2` is not a non-terminal in the above example: it is the second
instance of the non-terminal `M` in the rule.
Obviously this is a reordering rule.

In general we use different types of rule to distinguish different
translation cases and obtain a finer-grained model. In this example, the `S`
rules are doing something very similar to the glue rules used in
Hiero-style systems; the `M` rules can be regarded as monotonic
translation rules; the `V` rules can be regarded as reordering
translation rules and phrasal translation rules; and the `D` rule can be
regarded as an explicit operation of word deletion.

Note that there is a straight-forward correspondence between the
Hiero-style rule notation introduced by [\ref Chiang2007]
and the HiFST rule file format (for rules with
one-dimensional weights).  For example, the HiFST grammar file entries

    V 164_M2_6_M1 78_M1_8_M2 -0.226464
    S S_X S_X 0.05768

can be written as

    V -> < 164 M2 6 M1 ,  78 M1 8 M2 > / -0.226464
    S -> < S X , S X > / 0.05768


\subsection tgrammars_shallow  Shallow-N Translation Grammars

Shallow grammars [\ref deGispert2010] can be used to control the degree of nesting allowed within an hierarchical grammar.
For example, for a Shallow-1 Grammar, variables in a rule can be substituted only by phrases. That is,
hierarchical rules can be used only once to generate words; once a hierarchical rule is used, translation relies on glue rules to cover longer source spans.

Formally, we use W to denote the set of terminals, and S
and X to denote two non-terminals. A simple
Hiero-style grammar can be defined to be:

     S -> X, X
     S -> S X, S X
     X -> a, b        where a, b \in ({X} union W)^+

We can transform this into a Shallow-1 grammar as

     S -> X, X
     S -> S X, S X
     Y -> a, b        where a, b \in {W}^+
     X -> u, v        where u, v \in {{Y} union W}^+

Here `Y` is introduced to handle phrasal translations. The variables in rule `X -> u, v` can only be substituted with the `Y` rules.

In some cases it is desirable to allow more complex movement in
translation, such as complex structure movements in Chinese-English
translation. For this we can use a generalisation of the simple
Shallow-1 grammar, called Shallow-N grammars.  These grammars allow hierarchical
rules to be applied up to N times.
For example, below is the form of a Shallow-2 grammar.

     S -> X, X
     S -> S X, S X
     Y^0 -> a^0, b^0  where a^0, b^0 \in {W}^+
     Y^1 -> a^1, b^1  where a^1, b^1 \in {{Y^0} union W}^+
     X -> u, v        where u, v \in {{Y^1} union W}^+


The Shallow-2 grammar introduces `Y^0` and `Y^1` to handle hierarchical
rule application at two levels within a derivation. For more detailed
description of Shallow-n grammars, please refer to the HiFST paper [\ref deGispert2010].
